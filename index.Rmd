# Welcome!

*The Soul’s Inner Statues* is a practitioner-to-practitioner guidebook for anyone who wants to get started worshipping many Gods. Whether you identify as pagan, a polytheist, or a spiritual person looking to develop a solid practice, the functional advice and applied theology in these pages provides advice on how to select who to worship, how to build daily prayer into your life, and how to approach everything from your lifelong learning goals to ethics to joining groups from that core activity. It is written from a Platonizing framework by someone raised in modern Neopaganism, and the guidance is grounded in lived experience.

The book is based on blog posts, with additional information and contexts, on [KALLISTI](https://kallisti.blog), and on a blog of the same name that preexisted it. Most content was sourced from posts dating between 2009-2022. The public beta was released in March 2022 in a **public beta** phase, and revisions started on 1 July 2022 — as of 10 July 2022, all chapters have been updated, but the author is working on formatting citations and enhancing the bibliography, so there will continue to be some minor updates. Feedback may be directed to kallisti [@] fea [.] st. You can also [log an Issue in GitHub](https://github.com/kayeofswords/soulsinnerstatues/).
