# Welcome!

*The Soul’s Inner Statues* is a guidebook for anyone who wants to get started worshipping many Gods, written from a slightly Platonizing framework. It is designed to be broadly relevant.

The book is based on blog posts, with additional information and contexts, on [KALLISTI](https://kallisti.blog), and on a blog of the same name that preexisted it. Most content was sourced from posts dating between 2009-2022. Currently, as of 9 March 2022, this project is in a **public beta** phase, with revisions anticipated over the summer. Feedback may be directed to kallisti [@] fea [.] st. You can also [log an Issue in GitHub](https://github.com/kayeofswords/soulsinnerstatues/).

[You can download an ePub of this book (compatible with most eReading apps, including Google Play Books and Apple iBooks) here.](souls-inner-statues.epub)

There is an in-progress PDF located [in the GitHub codebase](https://github.com/kayeofswords/soulsinnerstatues/tree/master/docs).
