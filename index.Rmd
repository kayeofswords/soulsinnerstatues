# Welcome!

*The Soul’s Inner Statues* is a guidebook for anyone who wants to get started worshipping many Gods. The book is based on blog posts, with additional information and contexts, on [KALLISTI](https://kallisti.blog), and on a blog of the same name that preexisted it. Most content was sourced from posts dating between 2009-2022.
