A *group* is any collection of people, whether it has convened informally or formally. It could be your family, a collection of people you've met online, or a few people in town with whom you get drinks and catch up. It could also be your team at work, the members of an organization, or people on the membership rolls of a specific religion. In this chapter, we will discuss some ways to approach other people.

Jean-Paul Sartre wrote that [Hell is other people](https://www.vox.com/2014/11/17/7229547/philosophy-quotes-misunderstood-wittgenstein-sartre-descartes), and to a certain extent, that is true. In the article I just linked, the writer explains that it's not because people irritate us and we have painful interpersonal drama, but because we are judged and judge in social situations. We can be both the victims of cruelty and the ones who mete it out. Now, in the context of many Gods, there is no hell that directly corresponds to the Christian one — the closest in the belief system I follow would be Tartarus, which is where souls that have made many bad decisions in their most recent life are purified. (Imagine if you were put in a room with a firm, yet compassionate, therapist-judge and couldn't leave until you'd worked through all you had going on in your last life.) Other belief systems have similar states of being. The point, however, is that we can be awful to one another.

Paradoxically, *Homo sapiens sapiens* is a species that evolved to be most at ease in tribal bands of 50-200 people. We need other people for psychological safety, well-being, and a sense of belonging. We have trouble with groups larger than that because our brains struggle with depersonalizing others. Even the most introverted want to feel a sense of respect and care from people in their immediate community. In a spiritual sense, it can be good to have family and friends to decompress with about spiritual issues and with whom you can celebrate larger holidays.

## Family

I am very lucky in that I grew up praying to mother Goddesses in the backwoods. I was with my family and in a very loose community. We went to a Unitarian Society many Sundays, although the religious education program for kids was often more miss than hit, but the true joys were when we convened every six weeks at a rural property and were able to process to a sacred place, do a ritual, and have a potluck in community afterward. We celebrated the seasons, the elements, a God, and a Goddess.

My parents never required that we participate, and we rarely did family rituals at home. I am an “okay, let's do this” person when it comes to spirituality. The Christian sect we were in when I was a young child made no sense, and when we apostatized, I was relieved because the framework of many Gods felt right — and later on, when I became interested in theology, my feelings became grounded in something more. My youngest sister rebelled against the family by getting interested in very conservative Christianity as a teen, and she's vaguely spiritual now. My middle sister felt that she wasn't included in the family rituals and that it was “our thing” — for our parents and me. I only learned this after we were all adults and when she discussed wanting to go deeper into the practice, and it made me feel awful. 

Based on comparing our childhood experiences, I do recommend involving your kids — if you can — in many Gods. Let them know that they're included, explain why you pray to the Gods you pray to and that they're welcome to pray to whomever they like, and be open to their participation in your daily rituals if they want that. If they want a sacred space in their rooms, help them. I started using candles in my room when I was twelve, at about the same age I started doing my family's laundry and much of my family's weeknight cooking. You know your children and their maturity level. Depending on your kids and their engagement with large media franchises, you may have to explain how worshipping Greek deities is different from Percy Jackson (the “chosenness” thing can be particularly tricky for kids; I remember encountering a bunch of teens once who thought they were demigod children of deities because they'd fallen into that extreme belief online) or how the Marvel characters named for Norse Gods are just fun interpretations of myth from people who are mostly atheists.

➡ Make sure that, to the extent possible, any shared family ritual time is a device-free zone. It's OK to use eReaders or phones to access texts, show sacred images, or use a playlist. ⬅

Sometimes, a person starts following many Gods after a period of significant trauma in their early religious life, such as those who left cults. Emphasizing participation in spirituality or even teaching a child ethics can bring up feelings about what happened when the parent was younger. Keep in mind that your child may have no idea, or only a vague idea, of what happened to you. Shield them from your experience by being open-minded, but inclusive. Emphasize ethics, but be sure to emhpasize a growth mindset in which we as individuals are continuously learning to be better people, not one in which small mistakes are damning. If you can, consider seeing an individual or family therapist.

Finally, involving your kid comes with some important safety tips. To be blunt, your child will go online — either with your permission or in secret. What you want is for your child to have a firm foundation in reality so they don’t end up joining a cult or some fringe group that believes it is channeling new physics from aliens on a planet orbiting Zeta Reticuli. Critical thinking skills are an absolute must. Teach your kids how to distinguish among religion, mystical/esoteric practices, New Age, and the occult. This can be more challenging for children who have a score of four or higher on ACE (Adverse Child Experiences), which correlates with higer chances of self-soothing escapism and failure to thrive as adults. I have an ACE score of 4, and I held some embarrassing beliefs in my late teens as a way of self-soothing. It wasn't until going to therapy in my late 20s and graduating from therapy after getting very into Platonism and learning growth-based frames for thinking about myself and my life experiences that I started to feel steady.

Even when something they encounter online isn’t cut off from reality, there is so much overlap online among pagans, polytheists, and indigenous traditions, on the one hand, and New Age, the occult, and witchcraft on the other. Online, we are all exposed to new ideas from people with backgrounds that are completely unfamiliar to us, good and bad. *The Soul's Inner Statues* is emphasizing a theistic, many-Gods approach that is not overly tied to any of these things — and if that approach is what you are most comfortable with, keep that identity at your heart when you and your kids go online.

Kids don’t need to be watched every second online, but they do need structure, critical thinking, and parents who care about their spiritual lives. They need to be taught what boundaries are. And you, as a parent, if you are in an awful relationship that is harming your kids, need to actually end that relationship instead of dragging it on because our society has told you that divorce is worse than an unsafe home.

## Partners and Roommates

If you have other adults in your living space, like a spouse or roommate, involving them in your religion could take several forms. If the other adult also worships many Gods (likely different ones), holidays in your respective traditions are opportunities to share food and stories and pray together. If your spouse or roommates are not religious, they may also be perfectly fine with sharing a special meal for holidays — most nonreligious people and atheists are not antireligious even if YouTube comments and online trolls indicate otherwise. If your spouse or roommate is antireligious, you will likely experience substantial friction. Members of exclusivist monotheistic faiths who are progressive may also be willing to have meals with you, but more conservative ones will likely have issues with you and call you an idolater. I know someone whose spouse believes she is consorting with demons, and it's psychologically hard for her as someone who is drawn to worshipping other Gods to have her spouse be that hostile.

## Finding People

This section relies on three words for types of relationships: parasociality, acquaintanceship, and friendship. In the United States, many people will not distinguish between acquaintances and friends, but I find that this is a crucial personal frame to help me calibrate my social obligations towards others, especially as someone who was not trained to have good empathic boundaries as a child.

*Parasocial* is a term developed in the mid-1950s to describe the relationship between TV personalities and their audiences. In the online era, Influencers began using it to describe their relationships with the massive numbers of people who interact with them. More recently, it has begun to refer to interactions among people who really don't know each other online — you follow their content, they follow yours, but you two do not interact as either acquaintances or friends. In a parasocial relationship, we typically have one-sided information about someone. Online, we tend to share carefully-curated details about our lives, so much so that others feel they know and trust us when we may have only a vague idea of who they even are, if any idea at all. It plays with the follower's emotions and may lead to feelings of devotion, allegiance, goodwill, betrayal, moral outrage, and social rejection, as mercurial as a stormy sea. While most of us do not have a huge online reach, Influencers and celebrities do, and they experience the downsides of parasocial relationships more intensely than the rest of us.

*Acquaintanceship* is a mutual state in which you vaguely know someone, but may not be on the same page about who both of you are. Distant acquaintances are people who see each other and say hi at the gym or while catching transit. Close acquaintances are people who have decided that they care about each other in a vague social sense, enough to have genuine interest in how the other is doing and perhaps learn the names of one another's pets or children. The mutuality is key here — whereas in a parasocial relationship, you are engaging with someone's broadcasted content, in an acquaintanceship, you are actually getting to know each other. Many acquaintances are perfectly happy not to have a deeper level of engagement. Aristotle, while he had a dubious understanding of the Platonic Forms and an irritating lack of respect for women, has a lot of really useful perspective in the *Nichomachean Ethics* (chapters 8 and 9) for thinking about friendship. He describes something called a “friendship based on utility” that “belongs to the marketplace” (1158a, ln. 21-23). Utilitarian friendships, in my opinion, are actually professional, collegial, or logistical close acquaintanceships.

*Friendship*, like acquaintanceship, comes in two layers: casual and close. Casual friends care about one another, take interest in one another's lives, and may have some shared values in common. They may also be members of a social cluster who are more peripheral to each other than to others in the group, or they may have become friends due to shared professional or personal experiences. Friendship of this nature is also friendship between those who are prepared to be mutual and who see one another at (roughly) the same level. There may be differences of age, social class, or cultural background, but friends see one another as equals. The “purification of correction” (a concept I've read about in Platonists) or the mutual checks one makes with one another, is available at this level of interaction because friends generally want what is best for one another and care enough to allow the other to be imperfect. 

Aristotle writes that “a wish for friendship arises swiftly, but friendship itself does not” (1156b, 30). This is true in both the transition of acquaintances to friends and about the transition from casual to close friends. While in a casual friendship, one might censor oneself and keep things private, close friends generally share much more of themselves with one another. Aristotle calls this form of friendship *complete friendship* (1156b, line 5)— the two of you have similar gasps of virtue and enough similarity in outlook that you can know and accept one another's character. A person cannot sustain many of these relationships at once. Close friendship is also where ethical imperatives towards one's associates come in full force — Solon's ethical tenets instruct us to be slow in making friends, but not to abandon them once we have solidified our friendship. That makes the most sense when applied to friends who are approaching or at closeness. Aristotle provides guidance on this, too, in the *Nicomachean Ethics*, saying that corruptions of virtue and outlook among our close friends must be approached with care for their character, not out of interest in their public persona or property or the utilitarian benefits of the friendship. Even when a friendship cannot be maintained, he writes that “on account of their prior friendship, [they must] render something to those who were once friends, when its dissolution was not due to excessive corruption” (1165b, with the quotation from line 35). Ending a friendship is a last resort. And trust me: If one of your friends gets cancelled or doxxed by parasocials, you will feel the heat from this, and the parasocials will assume you have no moral backbone and are willing to just chuck your friend to the curb at the drop of a hat. 

While in a parasocial relationship, the feelings of betrayal have no actual basis in mutual care, feelings of betrayal and hurt when something bad happens in a casual or close friendship are based on a real, intangible connection. They can often be resolved by actually talking it out with the friend. Unlike with children, irreversible fallouts rarely happen at the drop of a hat. You can be more of your whole self with close friends without fearing that they will turn on you or that their care is conditional.

I started this section with an overview of friendships for one key reason: **Just because others worship Gods, and even the same Gods as you, doesn't mean you'll all get along.** This is a painful life lesson. Our personalities are all unique, no matter how we try to bin them into categories with Myers-Briggs, astrology, and so on. One might think that being in the series of the same God, if two people were to be blessed with confident insight into that, would make them instant friends. Even in that case, since a God is everything in a unique way, and as each of us is a particular soul that expresses a unique fingerprint of that uniqueness, devotees express the full range of what that God is.

Ideally, when looking for people to approach about your mutual interest in the Gods, your goal is to identify candidates for close acquaintances and casual friends. Rarely, you will find new close friends.

### Local Organizations

Depending on the size and demographics of your local area, there may be people nearby with preexisting groups that you can join. Shops that sell alternative religious materials (like incense, deity statues, and so on) often have good inventories of what is available nearby. You can also use Meetup and check for groups on social media that are local. Many groups will have some public events even if their core activites are private and members-only.

If you are worshipping deities that have temples or shrines in your metro area, learn more about the organization and contact them to ask if it is possible for you to pray there. Generally speaking, they will have volunteers and other people who would be happy to show a respectful outsider how to engage with the Gods in a tactful manner.

### Social Media

To find friends in the 2020s, most people start on social media, private Discord or Slack chats, and Internet forums. There are some important pitfalls to this, and I advise you to use social media strategically to identify people you actually want to talk to. Once you have that, get out. Especially in private Discords that are run by Influencer personalities, things can quickly go south into cult-land. 

The reason I encourage you to have an exit game is that the psychological impacts of heavy social media use are similar to other high-risk addictive behaviors. Once you feel parasocially obligated to be online and post to a large audience, you will also likely be trapped on Twitter, in Facebook groups, or on Instagram or TikTok. Studies show that people who are primarily active on social media for their social interaction face higher rates of anxiety and depression, as social media doses us with dopamine using algorithms similar to casino slot machines. Parasocial validation cannot functionally replace getting to know people in person.

While you are on social media, be it TikTok, Facebook, Twitter, or the latest and greatest new platform, do not feel pressure to follow back or friend anyone. Your update feed is your space. Look at the person's profile and decide if you find their updates parasocially relevant. Then decide if you think they're acquaintance material. Make your decisions based on that. I rarely follow back immediately — it may take me weeks, months, or years to make that decision. Most people I follow are those writing content that I have found useful. In private social media spaces, I only let people see my content if I feel comfortable having them see it.

Facebook and Instagram groups about the Gods are also filled with what I like to call aesthetic posts — people posing with animal skins, horns, period clothing, and other items. It is materialistic and annoying for people who are actually there for content that helps them grow spiritually. It can also trigger our acquisitive instincts due to the human instinct to conform to group norms. Even when people post shrines, it can be intimidating for people whose setups are simpler and less expensive. Unless you know someone, you have no idea if they've been practicing for 20 years and have built their shrine items up over that amount of time or if they've gone into debt buying all of those items two months ago.

Social media also rewards oversharing and a lack of personal filter/boundaries. For this reason, spiritual bypassing, out-of-the-norm experiences, and misinformation are all rewarded by the algorithms. Rather than sit with a private experience for a while, many people instantly share what they think happened online. Sharing personal experiences is best done first in a private journal, then among people one actually knows. Because many of us are lonely and lack close friends, social media oversharing becomes even more seductive. We are all more likely to post when we are feeling strong emotions, too, like when online misinformation pushes our buttons.

Also, remember that when fights happen on social media, most people in the conversations are fighting with shadows created by their own fears, not with you. This is why people can get so vindictive — the depersonalization of online interactions combines with whatever is going on in their psyches to create the perfect storm. If you have learned techniques from difficult conversations trainings (my workplace has these all the time), now is the time to use them. However, it's not possible to deescalate everything.

## The Mechanics of Group Ritual

Once you find one or more people to do ritual with, it's time to look at your longer ritual outlines. Typically, whether you do a ritual in-person or on Zoom, you will need to share the ritual outline ahead of time. If everyone involved worships many Gods, there may be edits and amendments based on elements of practice that others want to include. Google Docs or another multi-person editing tool is great for this.

Collaboratively assign people roles. When I was growing up, we knew that the hosts who owned the property would be managing the overall ritual, but they took volunteers for invoking the elements and the ritual's deities, often before the ritual when they knew who would show up. In Google Drive, people can write their names next to the sections they wish to run.

If running a ritual on Zoom or another videoconferencing platform, be sure that someone is taking the role of Zoom host — this person can spotlight the person doing the ritual section. Chanting isn't as easy on Zoom as it is in person, so you may want to mute yourself and just go along with the chant leader. Be clear with everyone whether you are all doing the ritual simultaneously together (with similar offerings and space setups) or if one person will show the ritual setup and make the offerings. If it's the latter, the designated ritual space provider should be spotlighted even when others are reading.

Some groups will do a debrief of the entire ritual immediately before the ritual takes place, which can be tedious for those who came prepared. I recommend doing this offline and setting an expectation that everyone is reading through it in advance. If new people are present who are unfamiliar, do not assign them anything, but make sure you or another person welcomes them and is available to answer any questions during or after the ritual.

Most often, people will use their own homes for rituals and trust that guests will follow rules of hospitality. They may also secure permits to do rituals in public spaces like parks if the ritual is large enough; if it's only a few people, they might not. Less frequently, groups may rent a space (a Unitarian Universalist Church is great for that), which can help establish trust among people who don't know one another well enough to feel okay sharing their home address and welcoming others into their spaces. Depending on the tradition, there may be an established temple/ritual space supported by community members.

## Joining Groups

So, let's say that you decide you like a group — online or offline — and want to be a joiner. When you are making your decision, here are some things to look for:

1. Does the group have a nondiscrimination policy? How is it enforced? Is training mandatory for officers? Many are quick to sign statements about inclusivity, but few are willing to put in the work to ensure that leaders are actually prepared to handle such situations.
2. Is the group centered around a single person? If it is centered around one person, is it because they have the highest level of training in the tradition? Who trained them? Is there an accountability structure that applies to people with their level of training at the regional, national, or international level? How are officers and leaders of the group chosen?
3. Has the group appeared in the news associated with any cult scandals? Have former members written any exposés? What did they say, and how did the group respond?
4. If the group is claiming to be a revival of a tradition from a region, are people who are descendants of the group(s) living in that region represented in leadership positions? What do members of the group say about those living descendants in general? Thinking back to the cultural appropriation content in Chapter Two, are they engaging in any red flags? Are they open to modern interpretations, or do they prefer reenactment?
5. If you have children, is the group child-friendly?
6. What are the educational development opportunities for members?
7. Is the group legally incorporated? This isn't a dealbreaker, but groups that have legally incorporated are often more stable than ones that are not.

With these questions, you should be prepared to view the organization's website or ask questions of members of the group if you attend a few rituals and want to know more about them. I was once in a group where long-term members repeatedly described, in an elated way, how they thought outsiders would go after them and how they were prepared for the worst. That was only one red flag of many. Red flags like this one will likely not be on their website — you have to get to know people.

Once you have found a group, sign up for its listservs, forums, and other online presence locations. Try to make at least a few of their in-person or online meetups when possible. When I first joined a group, I lurked for a long time, but it meant that I didn't get a feel for what other people in the group were like until I was eligibile for leadership positions, and I came to know that we did not have compatible values.

### When Leaders Go Bad

Throughout our youths, we come to know that the authority figures in our lives — our parents, other adults, religious teachers, and so on — are just as human and fallible as we are. The first time I saw someone I considered a spiritual leader behave in a toxic way online, I was in my early 20s. Nowadays, with the way social media is designed, I imagine people have this shock at a much younger age. It felt awful, but I was only *witnessing* what was happening, and it hardly impacted me at all beyond having to process extreme disappointment.

Unfortunately, that experience is mild in comparison with what happens to many other people. Cults, sexual abuse, and similar horrors are rampant in spiritual spaces. These things may be centered around a specific person, or they may take place within the context of a group's organizational structure.

When it comes to individuals, we can draw some understanding from the commentary that Edwin F. Bryant made on Patañjali's *Yoga Sūtras*. In the chapter on meditative absorption, Bryant translates I.15 as, Dispassion is the controlled consciousness of one who is without craving for sense objects, whether these are actually perceived or described” (p. 52). He cites two prior commentators on the same passage of the *Yoga Sūtras*: dispassion is “indifference to objects even when these are available” (Vācaspati Miśra) and includes “members of the opposite sex, food, drink, and power” (Vyāsa). It dovetails aptly with things said in Platonism about control of the passions of the appetitive and spirited parts of the human soul, which — when they are left unchecked because someone has not properly brought them into alignment — lead to disasters great and small. “The wise,” Bryant continues, “strive for detachment and the eternal experience of the soul rather than the never-ending pursuit of ephemeral pleasure” (p. 53).

It is that detachment that allows someone to lead a group without allowing the power to get to their head — and, crucially, even when someone starts out holy, they can backslide. Spiritual teachers are honestly some of the most vulnerable people to tyrannical downfalls, vice, and abuse, partially because people trust them, and we are less likely to hold people we admire accountable. The goal of being a guide for others is to positively impact others' minds and souls, and those others then open up and become vulnerable. Socrates gets into how devastating spiritual abuse can be at Phaedo 89d-e, as it hardens people against any spirituality or truth-seeking at all and just leaves them jaded. A spiritual teacher still needs a group of peers and friends to hold them accountable, people who are not afraid to say the hard things.

In the same commentary on the *Yoga Sūtras*, at I.14, “practice becomes firmly established when it has been cultivated uninterruptedly and with devotion over a prolonged period of time” (p. 49), Bryant takes what Patañjali has written here to comment on the steady stream of abuse scandals in yoga. According to him, the practice must be cultivated continuously, like a garden. Otherwise, disaster may happen:

>As an aside, many Hindu gurus and yogīs have been embroiled in scandals that have brought disrepute to the transplantation of yoga and other Indic spiritual systems to the West. This sūtra provides a mechanism of interpreting such occurrences. If one reads the early hagiographies of many Hindu gurus whose integrity was later found compromised, one is struck by the intensity, devotedness, and accomplishments of their initial practices. Nonetheless, however accomplished a yogī may become, if he or she abandons the practice of yoga under the notion of being enlightened or of having arrived at a point beyond the need of practice, it may be only a matter of time before past saṁskāras, including those of past sensual indulgences, now unimpeded by practice, begin to surface. The result is scandal and traumatized disciples. There is no flower bed, however perfected, that can counteract the relentless emergence of weeds if left unattended. As Patañjali will discuss later in the text, as long as one is embodied, saṁskāras remain latent, and therefore potential, in the citta [mind]. Hence one can read this sūtra as indicating that since the practices of yoga must be uninterrupted, one would be wise to politely avoid yogīs or gurus who claim to have attained a state of enlightenment such that they have transcended the need for the practice and renunciation presented by Patañjali here.  /
Yoga Sūtras, trans. Bryant, p. 51

This passage could apply to any spiritual community: The leaders cannot, for the sake of those following them, fall prey to power. Sometimes, people go into leadership positions because they feel a lack that they believe only power over others can provide, and they spend the remainder of their lives hiding skeletons in their closets and using their current followers as a replacement for real self-work. Leadership often ends badly for them. In any case, the fallout impacts the entire group. It is negligence at its best, calculated indifference to the welfare of others at its worst. All teachers need training and accountability. All teachers need to demonstrate care towards the souls of others, imitating the Gods, as the Gods are wholly good.

Beyond leaders and teachers, in a group context, toxic ones scare people with what will happen to them. They ostracize someone who criticizes a group policy. They terrorize people if they make even simple human mistakes. They judge and punish if someone likes the wrong books, buys food the group doesn't approve of, or displays negative emotions. Meanwhile, they puff up followers with the idea that they are members of a special, awakened elite. You cannot be compassionate or cultivate civic virtue if you internalize us/them exclusivity rhetoric. 

Often, those drawn into a cult are people who are motivated to do good in the world — just as Plato teaches, people always want to do what they think is best, even if they are in error. Their strong motivation to do good is manipulated through love-bombing and the fear of ostracism and hatred from the people they respect. Us/them thinking and “we’re the only good people and you must believe these specific doctrines, and these alone” rhetoric is extremely prevalent in online New Religious Movement communities in the 2020s, on the right and the left. Do not trust people who try to cut you off from different ideas while threatening to ostracize you if you disobey.

Paradoxically, the language of “we’re a niche” is also used in a less intense way in nontoxic systems. In Platonism, for example, theurgic and philosophical incarnation choices are prioritized for achieving henosis and a providential exit from the current cosmic cycle. But it encourages critical thinking at the same time — you are supposed to question, to work through the dialogues, to understand that even the holiest people incarnated were human beings. It is a torch relay. When people try to misapply Platonism for spiritual bypassing or to gain power, they will often be overly literal in interpreting texts and/or fuse Platonism with a reactionary zeitgeist.

Be wary of leaders who try to twist your embodiment anxiety into something toxic to your mind. Be wary of leaders who plaster their faces everywhere — while dead holy people are honored with libations and appropriate commemorative well-wishes, they should not be revered as if they are on the same status as the Gods — and those who scare you into silence with the threat of ostracism if you question anything or have slightly different beliefs than they do. 

The Gods are the wellsprings of human happiness, as per Iamblichus. Humans are an ocean of transient pleasures and pains. Follow the Gods, and they will lead you up the mountain to touch the sky. Follow humans uncritically, and they may very well lead you to the bottom of an ocean trench.


## Exercise: Know What You Want

Research groups, either tradition-specific or not, to investigate. Use the questions above to narrow down to one or two (if possible) to learn more about. Try attending one of their open events if you can.

Meanwhile, identify what you want in online or in-person spiritual friends. What are your dealbreakers? Where do you plan to meet people? If you plan to use social media, what rules do you want to set around using the platform?

These questions are ideal for answering in a journal or text file, and you can refer back to them over the next few months. I recommend checking in about your social media habits at least monthly to ensure that you are not succumbing to overuse.
