A *group* is any collection of people, whether it has convened informally or formally. It could be your family, a collection of people you've met online, or a few people in town with whom you get drinks and catch up. It could also be your team at work, the members of an organization, or people on the membership rolls of a specific religion. In this chapter, we will discuss some ways to approach other people.

Jean-Paul Sartre wrote that [Hell is other people](https://www.vox.com/2014/11/17/7229547/philosophy-quotes-misunderstood-wittgenstein-sartre-descartes), and to a certain extent, that is true. In the article I just linked, the writer explains that it's not because people irritate us and we have painful interpersonal drama, but because we are judged and judge in social situations. We can be both the victims of cruelty and the ones who mete it out. Now, in the context of many Gods, there is no hell that directly corresponds to the Christian one — the closest in the belief system I follow would be Tartarus, which is where souls that have made many bad decisions in their most recent life are purified. (Imagine if you were put in a room with a firm, yet compassionate, therapist-judge and couldn't leave until you'd worked through all you had going on in your last life.) Other belief systems have similar states of being. The point, however, is that we can be awful to one another.

Paradoxically, *Homo sapiens sapiens* is a species that evolved to be most at ease in tribal bands of 50-200 people. We need other people for psychological safety, well-being, and a sense of belonging. We have trouble with groups larger than that because our brains struggle with depersonalizing others. Even the most introverted want to feel a sense of respect and care from people in their immediate community. In a spiritual sense, it can be good to have family and friends to decompress with about spiritual issues and with whom you can celebrate larger holidays.

## Family

I am very lucky in that I grew up praying to mother Goddesses in the backwoods. I was with my family and in a very loose community. We went to a Unitarian Society many Sundays, although the religious education program for kids was often more miss than hit, but the true joys were when we convened every six weeks at a rural property and were able to process to a sacred place, do a ritual, and have a potluck in community afterward. We celebrated the seasons, the elements, a God, and a Goddess.

My parents never required that we participate, and we rarely did family rituals at home. I am an “okay, let's do this” person when it comes to spirituality. The Christian sect we were in when I was a young child made no sense, and when we apostatized, I was relieved because the framework of many Gods felt right — and later on, when I became interested in theology, my feelings became grounded in something more. My youngest sister rebelled against the family by getting interested in very conservative Christianity as a teen, and she's vaguely spiritual now. My middle sister felt that she wasn't included in the family rituals and that it was “our thing” — for our parents and me. I only learned this after we were all adults and when she discussed wanting to go deeper into the practice, and it made me feel awful. 

Based on comparing our childhood experiences, I do recommend involving your kids — if you can — in many Gods. Let them know that they're included, explain why you pray to the Gods you pray to and that they're welcome to pray to whomever they like, and be open to their participation in your daily rituals if they want that. If they want a sacred space in their rooms, help them. I started using candles in my room when I was twelve, at about the same age I started doing my family's laundry and much of my family's weeknight cooking. You know your children and their maturity level. Depending on your kids and their engagement with large media franchises, you may have to explain how worshipping Greek deities is different from Percy Jackson (the “chosenness” thing can be particularly tricky for kids; I remember encountering a bunch of teens once who thought they were demigod children of deities because they'd fallen into that extreme belief online) or how the Marvel characters named for Norse Gods are just fun interpretations of myth from people who are mostly atheists.

➡ Make sure that, to the extent possible, any shared family ritual time is a device-free zone. It's OK to use eReaders or phones to access texts, show sacred images, or use a playlist. ⬅

Sometimes, a person starts following many Gods after a period of significant trauma in their early religious life, such as those who left cults. Emphasizing participation in spirituality or even teaching a child ethics can bring up feelings about what happened when the parent was younger. Keep in mind that your child may have no idea, or only a vague idea, of what happened to you. Shield them from your experience by being open-minded, but inclusive. Emphasize ethics, but be sure to emhpasize a growth mindset in which we as individuals are continuously learning to be better people, not one in which small mistakes are damning. If you can, consider seeing an individual or family therapist.

Finally, involving your kid comes with some important safety tips. To be blunt, your child will go online — either with your permission or in secret. What you want is for your child to have a firm foundation in reality so they don’t end up joining a cult or some fringe group that believes it is channeling new physics from aliens on a planet orbiting Zeta Reticuli. Critical thinking skills are an absolute must. Teach your kids how to distinguish among religion, mystical/esoteric practices, New Age, and the occult. This can be more challenging for children who have a score of four or higher on ACE (Adverse Child Experiences), which correlates with higer chances of self-soothing escapism and failure to thrive as adults. I have an ACE score of 4, and I held some embarrassing beliefs in my late teens as a way of self-soothing. It wasn't until going to therapy in my late 20s and graduating from therapy after getting very into Platonism and learning growth-based frames for thinking about myself and my life experiences that I started to feel steady.

Even when something they encounter online isn’t cut off from reality, there is so much overlap online among pagans, polytheists, and indigenous traditions, on the one hand, and New Age, the occult, and witchcraft on the other. Online, we are all exposed to new ideas from people with backgrounds that are completely unfamiliar to us, good and bad. *The Soul's Inner Statues* is emphasizing a theistic, many-Gods approach that is not overly tied to any of these things — and if that approach is what you are most comfortable with, keep that identity at your heart when you and your kids go online.

Kids don’t need to be watched every second online, but they do need structure, critical thinking, and parents who care about their spiritual lives. They need to be taught what boundaries are. And you, as a parent, if you are in an awful relationship that is harming your kids, need to actually end that relationship instead of dragging it on because our society has told you that divorce is worse than an unsafe home.

## Partners and Roommates

If you have other adults in your living space, like a spouse or roommate, involving them in your religion could take several forms. If the other adult also worships many Gods (likely different ones), holidays in your respective traditions are opportunities to share food and stories and pray together. If your spouse or roommates are not religious, they may also be perfectly fine with sharing a special meal for holidays — most nonreligious people and atheists are not antireligious even if YouTube comments and online trolls indicate otherwise. If your spouse or roommate is antireligious, you will likely experience substantial friction. Members of exclusivist monotheistic faiths who are progressive may also be willing to have meals with you, but more conservative ones will likely have issues with you and call you an idolater. I know someone whose spouse believes she is consorting with demons, and it's very psychologically hard for her as someone who is drawn to worshipping other Gods.

## Finding People

This section relies on three words for types of relationships: parasociality, acquaintanceship, and friendship. In the United States, many people will not distinguish between acquaintances and friends, but I find that this is a crucial personal frame to help me calibrate my social obligations towards others, especially as someone who was not trained to have good empathic boundaries as a child.

*Parasocial* is a term developed in the mid-1950s to describe the relationship between TV personalities and their audiences. In the online era, Influencers began using it to describe their relationships with the massive numbers of people who interact with them. More recently, it has begun to refer to interactions among people who really don't know each other online — you follow their content, they follow yours, but you two do not interact as either acquaintances or friends. In a parasocial relationship, we typically have one-sided information about someone. Online, we tend to share carefully-curated details about our lives, so much so that others feel they know and trust us when we may have only a vague idea of who they even are, if any idea at all. It plays with the follower's emotions and may lead to feelings of devotion, allegiance, goodwill, betrayal, moral outrage, and social rejection, as mercurial as a stormy sea. While most of us do not have a huge online reach, Influencers and celebrities do, and they experience the downsides of parasocial relationships more intensely than the rest of us.

*Acquaintanceship* is a mutual state in which you vaguely know someone, but may not be on the same page about who both of you are. Distant acquaintances are people who see each other and say hi at the gym or while catching transit. Close acquaintances are people who have decided that they care about each other in a vague social sense, enough to have genuine interest in how the other is doing and perhaps learn the names of one another's pets or children. The mutuality is key here — whereas in a parasocial relationship, you are engaging with someone's broadcasted content, in an acquaintanceship, you are actually getting to know each other. Many acquaintances are perfectly happy not to have a deeper level of engagement. Aristotle, while he had a dubious understanding of the Platonic Forms and an irritating lack of respect for women, has a lot of really useful perspective in the *Nichomachean Ethics* (chapters 8 and 9) for thinking about friendship. He describes something called a “friendship based on utility” that “belongs to the marketplace” (1158a, ln. 21-23). Utilitarian friendships, in my opinion, are actually professional, collegial, or logistical close acquaintanceships.

*Friendship*, like acquaintanceship, comes in two layers: casual and close. Casual friends care about one another, take interest in one another's lives, and may have some shared values in common. They may also be members of a social cluster who are more peripheral to each other than to others in the group, or they may have become friends due to shared professional or personal experiences. Friendship of this nature is also friendship between those who are prepared to be mutual and who see one another at (roughly) the same level. There may be differences of age, social class, or cultural background, but friends see one another as equals. The “purification of correction” (a concept I've read about in Platonists) or the mutual checks one makes with one another, is available at this level of interaction because friends generally want what is best for one another and care enough to allow the other to be imperfect. 

Aristotle writes that “a wish for friendship arises swiftly, but friendship itself does not” (1156b, 30). This is true in both the transition of acquaintances to friends and about the transition from casual to close friends. While in a casual friendship, one might censor oneself and keep things private, close friends generally share much more of themselves with one another. Aristotle calls this form of friendship *complete friendship* (1156b, line 5)— the two of you have similar gasps of virtue and enough similarity in outlook that you can know and accept one another's character. A person cannot sustain many of these relationships at once. Close friendship is also where ethical imperatives towards one's associates come in full force — Solon's ethical tenets instruct us to be slow in making friends, but not to abandon them once we have solidified our friendship. That makes the most sense when applied to friends who are approaching or at closeness. Aristotle provides guidance on this, too, in the *Nicomachean Ethics*, saying that corruptions of virtue and outlook among our close friends must be approached with care for their character, not out of interest in their public persona or property or the utilitarian benefits of the friendship. Even when a friendship cannot be maintained, he writes that “on account of their prior friendship, [they must] render something to those who were once friends, when its dissolution was not due to excessive corruption” (1165b, with the quotation from line 35). Ending a friendship is a last resort. And trust me: If one of your friends gets cancelled or doxxed by parasocials, you will feel the heat from this, and the parasocials will assume you have no moral backbone and are willing to just chuck your friend to the curb at the drop of a hat. 

While in a parasocial relationship, the feelings of betrayal have no actual basis in mutual care, feelings of betrayal and hurt when something bad happens in a casual or close friendship are based on a real, intangible connection. They can often be resolved by actually talking it out with the friend. Unlike with children, irreversible fallouts rarely happen at the drop of a hat. You can be more of your whole self with close friends without fearing that they will turn on you or that their care is conditional.

I started this section with an overview of friendships for one key reason: **Just because others worship Gods, and even the same Gods as you, doesn't mean you'll all get along.** This is a painful life lesson. Our personalities are all unique, no matter how we try to bin them into categories with Myers-Briggs, astrology, and so on. One might think that being in the series of the same God, if two people were to be blessed with confident insight into that, would make them instant friends. Even in that case, since a God is everything in a unique way, and as each of us is a particular soul that expresses a unique fingerprint of that uniqueness, devotees express the full range of what that God is.

### Social Media

- Social media is a double-edged sword, and it's often a free-for-all
		- Know your goals for engaging
		- You don't need to follow back or friend
		- Avoiding FOMO and lifestyle creep on polytheist Instagram. Avoiding the weird fashion photography that is just trying to have ambiance for whatever reason.
		- Woo, spiritual bypassing, and misinformation
		- You don't need to have a specific set of political beliefs to belong
		- People are usually fighting with a shadow of their fears, not with you; this is why they can get so vindictive
		- Using difficult conversation techniques to bring things back on the rails when the worst happens

## The Mechanics of Group Ritual

Once you find one or more people to do ritual with, it's time to look at your longer ritual outlines. Typically, whether you do a ritual in-person or on Zoom, you will need to share the ritual outline ahead of time. If everyone involved worships many Gods, there may be edits and amendments based on elements of practice that others want to include. Google Docs or another multi-person editing tool is great for this.

Collaboratively assign people roles. When I was growing up, we knew that the hosts who owned the property would be managing the overall ritual, but they took volunteers for invoking the elements and the ritual's deities, often before the ritual when they knew who would show up. In Google Drive, people can write their names next to the sections they wish to run.

If running a ritual on Zoom or another videoconferencing platform, be sure that someone is taking the role of Zoom host — this person can spotlight the person doing the ritual section. Chanting isn't as easy on Zoom as it is in person, so you may want to mute yourself and just go along with the chant leader. Be clear with everyone whether you are all doing the ritual simultaneously together (with similar offerings and space setups) or if one person will show the ritual setup and make the offerings. If it's the latter, the designated ritual space provider should be spotlighted even when others are reading.

Some groups will do a debrief of the entire ritual immediately before the ritual takes place, which can be tedious for those who came prepared. I recommend doing this offline and setting an expectation that everyone is reading through it in advance. If new people are present who are unfamiliar, do not assign them anything, but make sure you or another person welcomes them and is available to answer any questions during or after the ritual.

Most often, people will use their own homes for rituals and trust that guests will follow rules of hospitality. They may also secure permits to do rituals in public spaces like parks if the ritual is large enough; if it's only a few people, they might not. Less frequently, groups may rent a space (a Unitarian Universalist Church is great for that), which can help establish trust among people who don't know one another well enough to feel okay sharing their home address and welcoming others into their spaces. Depending on the tradition, there may be an established temple/ritual space supported by community members.

## Joining Groups

### Cults

### Cultural Appropriation

## Exercise: Know What You Want

- Exercise: Research 2-3 groups, either tradition-specific or not, to investigate. What are their values? Are there checks and balances in their bylaws? What is the governance structure? Do they require any specific theological beliefs, or are they practice-focused? Are they based in your local community or online? Do they engage in any cultural appropriation red flags?
	- Exercise: Identify what you want in online or in-person polytheist friends. What are your dealbreakers? Where are you willing to look?
