# Appendix: Ritual Supplies and Your Budget

This appendix focuses on the budgetary logistics of maintaining a small household shrine, and at various price points.

What you place in a household shrine depends on what you can afford. This will range from things you repurpose from around the home to thrift store finds to purchases you make in stores or Etsy.

If you have no budet, save and clean several glass sauce jars. These can function as receptacles for libations or as vessels for pouring out the libation. 

If you have a bit of money, look in a thrift store for jars, pitchers, and nice bowls. (Thatâ€™s also a good time to pick up candle holders and candles.) 

If you have disposable income that you can use to invest in something fancy, Etsy is generally the place to go for finding artisans who create lovely work. In recent years, the selection of deity statues has increased, partially driven by demand, but also the increased presence of artisan shops online after the COVID-19 pandemic started. You can find a large variety based on the amount of space you have.
