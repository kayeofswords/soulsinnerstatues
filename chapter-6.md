>Virtue might be described as the perfection of the soul and proper balance of its life and as the highest and purest activity of reason and intellect and discursive intelligence. Let the acts of virtue be taken, above all, as being boniform, excellently fine, intellectual, noble, full of moderation, participant in appropriateness, promoting moral advancement, aiming at the best end, and graceful.  
Iamblichus, Letter 16: To Sopater, "On Virtue," trans. Dillon and Polleichtner

Cultivating virtue and adhering to an ethical system are absolutely essential for engaging with other people. If we define virtue as the excellence by which we are perfectly realizing our soul's capacity, becoming more virtuous is also an offering that we can give to the Gods, an intangible method of connecting our own partial existence to their expansive, limitless oneness.

Ethical guidance to follow may include things like the Delphic Maxims, Solon's Tenets, guidance within the Hávamál, Kemetic teachings on Ma'at, Pythagorean riddles and the exegesis on them,and so on. I encourage you to read as many systems as you need and to think about how they relate to your own life — what you can draw from them, what seems inappropriate. Typically, people will choose a system to look at that is related to the Gods they worship.

Many people were taught in their childhood that missteps and incorrect behavior were shameful, often in ways that made them feel powerless to change how others had judged them. This chapter will discuss virtue and ethics from a growth mindset — we all have to start somewhere, and we all have aspects of our lives that we nail and other parts of our lives where we need to put in more work.

A growth mindset is adequately described in this passage from Plotinus:

>If you do not yet see yourself as beautiful, then be like a sculptor who, making a statue that is supposed to be beautiful, removes a part here and polishes a part there so that he makes the latter smooth and the former just right until he has given the statue a beautiful face. In the same way, you should remove superfluities and straighten things that are crooked, work on the things that are dark, making them bright, and not stop ‘working on your statue’ until the divine splendour of virtue shines in you, until you see ‘Self-Control enthroned on the holy seat”  /
(Plotinus, Ennead 1.6.9, trans. Gerson)

In the above passage, we are encouraged to actually work on the parts of ourselves that seem daunting. From a practical standpoint, we can ask ourselves:

* What are my unhealthy habits?
* What do I lie to myself about?
* What have I been avoiding?
* Last time I had a conflict with someone, what went wrong? Is there anything I need to learn for the next time I am in a similar situation?
* In the past, what has worked for me when changing behavior? What hasn't worked?
* What are my strengths?
* How am I going to build self-care and self-compassion into my personal growth process?

The above questions may cause some distress, especially if we have been ignoring something for a long time. Look at pictures of cute animals, listen to relaxing music, and take care of yourself. Moral self-image stress can cause a lot of internal friction.

On a functional level, one of the reasons we have so many issues — at least in Platonism — is due to the operation of our three-part soul. As Plato's Socrates describes in the *Republic*, we have an appetitive soul (the seat of desire), described as many-headed; a spirited soul (the seat of emotional reactions), described as a lion; and the rational soul (the seat of our logical thinking), what makes us human. In embodiment, the soul's rational faculties are driven this way and that by the two layers of our irrational soul (appetitive and spirited). Many of our issues in life are due to not having a good handle on our impulses. The virtue that restrains the appetitive soul is temperance; the spirited soul, courage; and the rational soul, prudence. When everything is all working together properly, the soul can manifest justice and its highest potential. 

Platonism incorporates some elements of Aristotle and Stoic teachings to classify levels of virtue according to nature, habit, civic society, purificatory, contemplative, paradigmatic, and hieratic. Most people do not aim for the contemplative, paradigmatic, and hieratic virtues in their lives; to be functional members of society, we need to have everything up to the civic virtues nailed. The purificatory virtues signal a turn from that outer life to our own interior, culminating in the hieratic, which backflows outward from us and towards others through ritual action and care for the community. Tim Addey's *Unfolding Wings* discusses this in greater detail (Chapter 4), as does Mindy Mandell's *Discovering the Beauty of Wisdom* (Chapter 4). A good overview from an ancient commentator is Proclus' Essay 7 on the Republic, which is soon to be released in an English translation.

For the bad person, by contrast, it's just the opposite, since the bad person's soul is unpurified, whereas that of his opposite number is pure.

## Exercise: Contemplate Ethical Guidance

>Put more trust in nobility of character than in an oath. Never tell a lie. Pursue worthy aims. Do not be rash to make friends and, when once they are made, do not drop them. Learn to obey before you command. In giving advice seek to help, not to please, your friend. Be led by reason. Shun evil company. Honour the gods, reverence parents.
