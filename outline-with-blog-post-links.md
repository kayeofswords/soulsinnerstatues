- Ritual Purity
	- Physical purity
		- Showering
		- Wet wipes, sponges, and washing the hands
		- Accessibility
	- Mental purity
		- Mindfulness techniques
		- Grounding and centering
		- Social media breaks (and/or turning off notifications)
		- Write out your to-do lists
	- Fundamental point: If you wouldn't invite guests over while in this state, it's probably a time to either do purification or take time for yourself.
	- When you need to deal with the impact of embodiment, please be there for yourself
		- Mourning: wait until the new moon to pray again, and cover the shrine. You can still pray away from it and pray to ancestors. If a close relative dies, especially in the waning part of the lunar cycle, I recommend waiting a full lunar cycle and beginning again in the new moon. The night before the moon's first sliver, put a photo of your new ancestor on the ancestor shrine and do something nice for lim.
		- Birth/adoption/fostering: Introduce the newbie to the shrine after bathing
		- Menstruation: Be respectful if you are in a space where there are menstruant taboos (e.g., Kemetism, Hinduism), but otherwise, change your products and do not approach the shrine if you are experiencing debilitating pain.
		- Sex: Clean yourself up before you pray.
		- Sickness: If you are having an acute sickness, do not pray if you cannot otherwise get up to do ordinary household things without feeling ridiculously unwell. If you have a chronic illness and are having a flare-up, do not pray. I also recommend establishing a low-energy prayer routine, medium-energy prayer routine, and high-energy prayer routine so your practice can fit the rhythm of the condition you are managing.
	- If you join an initiatory tradition, some of these things may not apply because the initiatory tradition will have specific protocols for you
	- Exercise: Do a brief meditation or grounding and centering exercise, then pray to a household God, ancestors, or one of the Gods you have picked after the previous chapter. See how taking pause impacted you.

> The biggest thing to remember is that any ancestor or Chthonic god veneration should be kept separate from the place where you honor the heavenly and world-surface gods. Ideally, you would even use separate libation vessels and receptacles. In household worship, many make offerings to Ouranic deities according to specific lunar calendar cycles, and this can be done at the household shrine. The spaces for Chthonic gods and ancestors could legit be on a shelf just below the one you keep for the household gods.

	- Acknowledging cycles

	<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>There is, of course, a parallel with the sacred tradition which worships the former invisible [numbers] that are the causes of these [visible ones] by naming Night and Day as gods, as well as by delivering those things that commend one to the month and the year, the invocations and self-manifestations. These things are considered not as things to be totted up on one's fingers, but rather as among the things that have divine subsistence — things which the sacred laws of those who serve as priests command us to worship and honour by means of statues and sacrifices. The oracles of Apollo also confirm this, as the stories say, and when these things were honoured, the benefits that result from the periods belonged to human beings, both the benefits of the seasons and those of other [periods] similarly. However, when these things were neglected a condition contrary to nature was the result for everything around the Earth. Not only that, but Plato himself in the <em>Laws</em> (X 899b2) positively shouts out that all these things are gods: seasons, months and years — just like the stars and the Sun. We are introducing no sort of innovation when we say that it is worthwhile to conceive of the invisible powers that are prior to these visible things [as gods]. So much for these matters.</p><cite>Proclus, Commentary on Plato's <em>Timaeus</em>, Book 4 (confusingly, volume 5), 89.15-37, trans. Baltzly</cite></blockquote>

	- Offerings to the Gods
		- Incense, first fruits, flowers, libations
		- Meat/BBQ
		- Disposing of offerings
	- Opening and closing prayers
	- Example daily prayer
	- Example new moon prayer
	- Exercise: Create your own outline for a 5-10 minute prayer and offer that prayer in ritual. Make any edits you need to make, and ensure that a copy of that ritual outline (with all components) is on your phone or eReader so you can access it on the go

- Theological Underpinnings
	- Theistic practice is different from a philosophical commitment. My philosophical commitment is Platonism. Yours could be Yogic philosophy, Stoicism, or another school. We have practice in common even though our underpinnings may be different
	- The reading path I took in Platonism and how you can build a self-study path, if interested
	- If you're not intereseted in self-study, how to get a baseline understanding to prepare yourself for conversations about spirituality
	- Myths and theology
	- Pitfalls: Avoid atheizing/commercializing stuff
	- Reincarnation in Platonic thought
		- Choices of lives
		- Compassion and responsibility
		- Making things better
		- Liberation does not mean exiting; it means embracing who we are in the divine hierarchy and endeavoring to do the right thing
	- Commentary on Sallust using other Platonists to support what I am saying about Sallust
	- A walk through one of my prayers to all of the Gods to talk about what is happening at each level of the prayer
	- Exercise: Craft an "elevator pitch" about your spiritual practice for the Gods, with the goal of informing the person you are talking to about your values and goals

- Virtue
	- Its place in Platonism, hiearchy of virtues, and so on
	- Worshipping Many Gods and trying to be a good person
	- Sometimes the right thing isn't the easiest thing
	- Cleaning up your life without being too hard on yourself
		- What are your unhealthy habits?
		- What do you lie to yourself about?
		- What are your strengths?
		- What have you been avoiding?
	- Taking care of your mental health
		- Therapy

- Groups
	- What does "group" mean?
	- Family practice
	- Finding "your people" online and in person
	- Avoiding cults and cultish behavior
	- Just because others worship the same Gods, doesn't mean you'll get along
	- Cultural appropriation and white fragility
		- It's a red flag when people are obsessed with a specific historical period and not with worshipping the Gods within the cultural context they are in
	- Social media is a double-edged sword, and it's often a free-for-all
		- Know your goals for engaging
		- You don't need to follow back or friend
		- Avoiding FOMO and lifestyle creep on polytheist Instagram. Avoiding the weird fashion photography that is just trying to have ambiance for whatever reason.
		- Woo, spiritual bypassing, and misinformation
		- You don't need to have a specific set of political beliefs to belong
		- People are usually fighting with a shadow of their fears, not with you; this is why they can get so vindictive
		- Using difficult conversation techniques to bring things back on the rails when the worst happens
	- Parasociality, acquaintanceship, and friendship
	- Exercise: Research 2-3 groups, either tradition-specific or not, to investigate. What are their values? Are there checks and balances in their bylaws? What is the governance structure? Do they require any specific theological beliefs, or are they practice-focused? Are they based in your local community or online? Do they engage in any cultural appropriation red flags?
	- Exercise: Identify what you want in online or in-person polytheist friends. What are your dealbreakers? Where are you willing to look?

> What you place in your household shrine depends on what you can afford. If you are hurting for money, save and clean several glass jars you use for pasta sauce and other things. These can function as receptacles for libations or the vessels for making a libation.

> If you have a bit of money, look in a thrift store for jars, pitchers, and nice bowls. (That’s also a good time to pick up candle holders and candles.) If you have disposable income that you can use to invest in the polytheist community, Etsy is generally the place to go for finding Hellenic artisans and artists who make some very beautiful and functional religious stuff. <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/TheHellenicHandmaid?ref=l2-shopheader-name">The Hellenic Handmaid</a> is a great resource for libation receptacles.
