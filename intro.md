An image that has always struck me in Plato’s *Symposium* is that of a hollow woodland spirit’s statue being filled with small figurine icons of Gods before it is closed up and fitted together by its creator. These words are used to describe Socrates by one of his lapsed students, Alcibiades — a man who had strayed from the path of self-discovery and the love of wisdom, choosing instead to pursue his love of politics. Like him, many of us are divided into many pieces, from work to family to society, cast about like a tiny vessel on a tumultuous ocean. We struggle to know *where* we are, let alone *who* we are; forgetting our intrinsic wholeness, we seek to be whole. Coming to see the statues within ourselves — and anchoring ourselves to them in the quest to flourish as human beings — can go a long way to securing our inner calm, even in the face of grueling challenges or calamities or even the daily grind of work and life.

This book aims at being a small guidebook to that — a collection of words and practices that can withstand the sprays of water, the stinging salt, and the passage of time. It aims to create a systemic synthesis useful to those of us in modern times, especially we who live in cultural melting pots like the United States, as we ponder what allures us about the dazzling statues of Gods and the strangeness of stories hidden beneath the husk of commercialization and popular entertainment.

Finally, it is a hymn, both to the Gods and the underlying unity of all things that cannot be named, let alone conceived — to the ones whose images are nestled within our souls like jewels awaiting discovery and reunion with our everyday selves. “All things are full of Gods,” the ancient Greek statesman Thales once said. Iamblichus, a Syrian philosopher writing in the early common era, wrote that conceding the Gods’ existence was “not the right way to put it”; he continued that “an innate knowledge about the gods is coexistent with our nature, and is superior to all judgment and choice, reasoning and proof” and “[t]his knowledge is united from the outset with its own cause and exists in tandem with the essential striving of the soul towards the Good” (De mysteriis, trans. Clarke et al., 2013, I.3). Unpacking what Iamblichus said — the assumptions we may make on first reading it, the necessity of casting off misguided assumptions, and the joyous reality that unfolds as we open ourselves to the constellations of statues and the worlds within ourselves — is one of three mainsprings of this book.

## The Basics

This is a book about honoring Gods, and it is designed to be a practical work grounded in theory. While writing it, I had in mind an individual — perhaps spiritual-but-not-religious, maybe religious-but-looking-for-more, even not religious at all — who wants a connection to something greater than themselves. The word choice I have opted for in this book is intentionally uplifting and positive, as deciding to do something about that desire for spirituality means encountering an overwhelming about of information, some good, some misinformed. I believe that anyone, no matter your background, can develop a fulfilling private spiritual practice. 

Much as exercise is good for the body and meditation is good for the mind, revering the Gods is good for the soul. As with activities to strengthen the body and mind, establishing habitual ritual is good for its own sake — you do not need to pursue initiation or become a theologian or leader. While a person may occasionally pray and ask for something specific, it is not the primary purpose of venerating a higher power. Establishing a rhythm of sympathy with the Gods through repeated ritual acts is an end unto itself.

Ritual practice and contemplation are simple: you set aside time, and ideally a small amount of your space, to take pause and acknowledge the divine. For the purposes of this book, the divine consists of divine persons — Gods — who are each unique individuals. A ritual can be something as simple as lighting an electric or flame-based candle before murmuring a prayer of gratitude for another day. It could be pouring cool water into a bowl or sharing a few sips of one's morning coffee on the way out the door. It could be taking a few grounding breaths in front of an image of a God, cultivating fond feelings for what that God is known for and a desire to live up to that, in quiet meditation.

Often, when the average person thinks about Gods, the term “unique” becomes a proxy for “segmented into distinct offices” like Tupperware in the fridge after a big meal prep. We have a God for luck, a God for love, a God for healing, and it is only after plunging into worship that we learn that many of these labels are inaccurate and overly simplistic. Every God is very complicated, and as described by one modern theologian (CITE), each of them is a boundary-less, unique window on the universe. I pray to Apollon, for example, whose offices ultimately express that this God's perspective is one related to harmony — the entire universe can be viewed through that lens, and the God can encompass everything. The same is true of any other deity. 

It is the dizzyingly complex interpolation of a myriad Gods into the receptive beauty of matter that causes everything around us. The Gods flow forth with abundance. Like floodwaters bringing life to a desert, they give rise to intermediary spirits whose identities are often preserved in folklore, folk practices, and habitual rituals. 

Coming into harmony with the Gods, as Iamblichus taught, is the foundation of human happiness. This connection is something that cannot be taken away from any of us because it is innate. Like the image of Socrates as an artisinal work filled with Gods' statues, each of us contains a unique window on divine reality that can anchor us. Once we become conscious of this, we can adapt how we live our lives through ritual, contemplation, and mindfully tuning into the seasons of the year and our lives.

Despite calling it “simple”, I know that it can be very daunting to start a spiritual practice. Speaking as an American, many of us are taught that spiritual practice is something you get by paying money to attend a yoga class in a chic studio or filling a seat in a church beside other people who may or may not actually want to be there. Doing a prayer or small ritual every day can be seen as strange or over-the-top to some. However, it is far from uncommon among spiritual people. Zen practitioners, if they want to move from casual to proficient, are expected to do at least two hours of zazen practice each day (CITE). Muslims pray five times each day, and it is expected of everyone who is capable of it. In Shinto, those who keep kamidana (a type of household shrine for Kami, a word that describes a wide range of spiritual beings) give offerings daily, at least aspiratonally. 

Taking two to ten minutes a day to devote to one's spiritual practice is achievable to most people.

This book is about taking that statement — again, *two to ten minutes is achievable* — and making it achievable.

## Recommended Supplies

Each of these chapters contains small exercises designed to connect you to an aspect of the topic under investigation. Additional rituals and frameworks are included in the appendices, including a plan for annual rhythms that you can adapt to the context you need. This is the third mainspring: consciously choosing to engage in even the smallest practices can be a source of joy and a safe harbor for your inner light.

Sometimes, you will need materials. I recommend having a small bowl on hand, a vessel (like a jar) that contains water, and a slip of paper. If you can clear off a part of one shelf, that is ideal. If not, just use a clean surface and store your prayer materials in a clean box when you're not using them.

You can, of course, be more elaborate. Once we get going with the exercises, you will have opportunities to offer items like incense. When we move from talking about many Gods in the generic to actually choosing who to honor, you may want to purchase icons of those Gods or do research on Etsy to save up for one. This book is open access for a reason. I am aware that we have a variety of economic situations. Cultivating your inner light, and connecting to the Gods, is something that is accessible no matter how simple your prayer space is. One of the appendices documents how to identify useful shrine items at Goodwill, including the cost of getting all of the essentials. 

Many people end up engaging in spiritual consumerism and filling their prayer spaces up with things. I err on the functional side. Everything you put in this space is a tool, or a vessel, to help you connect to God(s). Some parts of these spaces — particularly the images of Gods — are extremely sacred. If a fire or other disaster came, how many of these precious images could we put in our go bags? Probably not many.

## Starting Prayer

After reading the section above, you may already be thinking about bowls and clearing spaces and everything else in this introductory chapter.

Let's take a quick pause.

Before doing any of that, be in a space where you will not be disturbed for two minutes. (It's OK if this is your car, but the bathroom is not appropriate.) Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths. Silently count to four while breathing in, and four while breathing out.

After a few cycles of breath, hold out your hands, with bent elbows, palms up. Your palms may either be together or apart.

At this point, you may either pray from the heart or use the words I am providing below. It is okay to open your eyes unless that is distracting for you.

> I honor and acknowledge the Gods I know, the Gods I do not know, and the good divinities willing to guide me. Please grant me what I need, and as I embark on a new beginning to study how best to approach you, may the actions I undertake guide me serendipitously to the place where I can be steady, happy, and truly free.

## Dedication

As one seeker of truth to another, I hope that the words in this book will be useful to your own voyage through life.

I will end the introduction with part of a prayer that I give every morning: 

Please, Apollon, let me find the still heart of truth at the core of all things. Please cultivate within me skill — in my poetry, in my prose, and in all of my actions, let all that I do flow forth from you. 

I will add to this a prayer to the Goddess Aletheia: 

May you, Aletheia, guide the reader towards truth and grant them a sip from your compassionate, abiding nectar, and may my words in this open access book be good enough to give them what they need for their journey.

This book is dedicated to Apollon and Aletheia.
