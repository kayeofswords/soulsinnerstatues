This chapter is titled *Foundations* because we will dive a bit deeper into thinking about Gods. It is also titled *Foundations* because the main practice at the end of this chapter involves the cleared-off section of shelf and small bowl I mentioned in the introduction.

Specifically, we will look at what Gods actually are, and we will use Plato's *Laws* to unpack the differences between theism and atheism. We will then consider the foundations of contemplative practices, ritual practices, and the foundations of household observances. Finally, you will have an opportunity to do some household observances on your own.

While explaining these things, I will ask you questions. One option when encountering these questions? Write out the answers, either longhand or in a text editor. Other options? If you are a parent, beholden to one or more demanding jobs with no work-life balance, or writing is just not accessible right now, that's okay. Think about these questions while you are in the shower, during your commute, or completing household tasks. If something comes up that you want to keep hold of for later, use a note-taking app on your phone or create a draft email that you will send to yourself.

## What is a God, Anyway?

In the Introduction, I quoted from two philosophers who were operating in a similar cultural context to each other. Thales, who was active before Socrates’ lifetime (and is thus called a "Presocratic"), said that the world is full of Gods; Iamblichus, a Syrian fluent in both his native culture and Greek culture of the late third century of our common era, described a God's existence as a given, but *strangely* so. 

Not once did I bring up the predomiant understanding of the word *God* in the modern era, which is often regared as a *specific* someone — an omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient being who is often tied to the initiatory rites of revealed religions that are tied to a specific prophet and holy book. My reluctance to bring this up is partly related to my own background — my outlook on the Gods is Platonizing, which means I do not believe that the first principle is capable of being described in that way. This is not a book about Platonic reverence for the Gods even though my bias is definitely at play. My second reason for *not* bringing it up in the introduction was that doing so would set an inappropriate tone for this work. My third reason is that I want to push back against the totalizing understanding of words like god, deity, or divinity.

*God* is used as a class term for a wide range of divine persons, sometimes accurately, sometimes imprecisely. Often, the term is used when translating indigenous terms for divine beings. The word *spirit* is used just as often. The Shinto term *Kami*, for example, describes a range of beings, some more reminiscent of divinities like nymphs, river deities, or house wights. The words *theos* and *daimon* in Greek are equally problematic. A daimon is an intermediary spirit that carries out specific functions, but sometimes, a God is called a daimon in the source texts! River divinities are usually referred to with *theos*, but are they a *theos* in the same way the Goddess Athene is? Which, if any, beings from another language receive the term “God”? “Spirit”? “Wight”? It depends on the biases of who is talking and if they have a specific set of beings in mind when they choose a word. This is one reason why Wikipedia is often not as good as going to a religious organization's website (or, for decentralized religions, a few sites put together by different practitioners) to learn about what its adherents believe.

Theological and philosophical exercises can get us down to stricter defintions and classes. In Platonism, these elastic terms have been refined into four classes: gods, angels, daimones, and heroes. The final three classes can be grouped under “daimones.” Each of the daimonic classes has less contact with the ultimate divine reality and more contact with variability and change. Divinities of the natural world and household inhabit the spaces “closest” to us. We are souls that incarnate in material bodies according to a long cycle. Other philosophical schools, like Yogic philosophy, Stoicism, or Daoist philosophy, may have different takes on this.

The *strict* definition of God I will take — and the one I mean when I discuss our inner core of happiness and the statues within us — are those individual divine powers who ground the entirety of reality. They slip and slide into one another, boundary-free because they preexist both limit and unlimitedness. They are the ones who we ultimately uncover in our practices. What is visible in breathtaking photographs from a space telescope or witness the powerful fury of the world around us, or even the small actions of our daily lives, are all ultimately grounded in *that* astonishing foundation. It is no wonder that Iamblichus wrote that “an innate knowledge about the gods is coexistent with our nature” and that they just *are*, but strangely so. The *loose* way in which I use the term “God” is when I am referring to any divine being and just not being specific enough.

Most of the time, though, I will refer to other categories of divine beings as spirits or divinities. I will also occasionally refer to ancestors. There may even be a triad of *Gods, spirits, and ancestors* in some of these materials.

What are the definitions you have heard for the term *God*? How do they differ from what I have said?

Try looking up the divine beings in a variety of traditions. What are the similarities? Differences? How well does the term *God* fit what you see?
