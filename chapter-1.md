This chapter is titled *Foundations* because we will dive a bit deeper into thinking about Gods. It is also titled *Foundations* because the main practice at the end of this chapter involves the cleared-off section of shelf and small bowl I mentioned in the introduction.

Specifically, we will look at what Gods actually are, and we will use Plato's *Laws* to unpack the differences between theism and atheism. We will then consider the foundations of contemplative practices, ritual practices, and household observances. Finally, you will have an opportunity to do some brief veneration on your own.

While explaining these things, I will ask you questions. One option when encountering these questions? Write out the answers, either longhand or in a text editor. Other options? If you are a parent, beholden to one or more demanding jobs with no work-life balance, or writing is just not accessible right now, that's okay. Think about these questions while you are in the shower, during your commute, or when completing tasks that don't require a heavy cognitive load. If something comes up that you want to keep hold of for later, use a note-taking app on your phone or create a draft email that you will send to yourself.

## What is a God, Anyway?

In the Introduction, I quoted from two philosophers who were operating in a similar cultural context to each other. Thales, who was active before Socrates’ lifetime (and is thus called a "Presocratic"), said that the world is full of Gods; Iamblichus, a Syrian fluent in both his native culture and Greek culture of the late third century of our common era, described a God's existence as a given, but *strangely* so. 

Not once did I bring up the predomiant understanding of the word *God* in the modern era, which is often regared as a *specific* someone — an omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient being who is often tied to the initiatory rites of revealed religions, a being only accessible when someone adheres to the correct holy book and prophet(s). Sometimes in spirituality circles, people refer to the Source, Spirit, or the One,  My reluctance to bring this up is partly related to my own background — my outlook on the Gods is Platonizing, which means that I do not believe that the first principle is capable of being described in that way. This is not a book about Platonic reverence for the Gods even though my bias is definitely at play. My second reason for *not* bringing it up in the introduction was that doing so would set an inappropriate tone for this work. My third reason is that I want to push back against the totalizing understanding of words like god, deity, or divinity.

*God* is used as a class term for a wide range of divine persons, sometimes accurately, sometimes imprecisely. Often, the term is used when translating indigenous terms for divine beings. The word *spirit* is used just as often. The Shinto term *Kami*, for example, describes a range of beings, with many of them more reminiscent of divinities like nymphs, river deities, or house wights. The words *theos* and *daimon* in Greek are equally problematic. A daimon is an intermediary spirit that carries out specific functions, but sometimes, a God is called a daimon in the source texts! River divinities are usually referred to with *theos*, but are they a *theos* in the same way the Goddess Athene is? Which, if any, beings from another language receive the term “God”? “Spirit”? “Wight”? It depends on the biases of who is translating and if they have a specific set of beings in mind when they choose a word. This is one reason why Wikipedia is often not as good as going to a religious organization's website (or, for decentralized religions, a few sites put together by different practitioners who have obvious close cultural ties) to learn about what its adherents believe.

Theological and philosophical exercises can get us down to stricter defintions and classes. In Platonism, these elastic terms have been refined into four classes: gods, angels, daimones, and heroes. The final three classes can be grouped under “daimones.” Each of the daimonic classes has less contact with the ultimate divine reality and more contact with variability and change. Divinities of the natural world and household inhabit the spaces “closest” to us. You and I are souls that incarnate in material bodies according to a long, regular cycle; a small sliver of us is permanent and divine like them, and that is what we want to cultivate as *I* in a spiritual practice. Other philosophical schools, like Yogic philosophy, Stoicism, or Daoist philosophy, have different takes on this.

The *strict* definition of God I will take — and the one I mean when I discuss our inner core of happiness and the statues within us — are those individual divine powers who ground the entirety of reality. They slip and slide into one another, boundary-free because they preexist both limit and unlimitedness. They are the ones who we ultimately uncover in our practices. What is visible in breathtaking photographs from a space telescope or witnessed in the powerful fury of the world around us, or even the small actions of our daily lives, are all ultimately grounded in *that* astonishing foundation. It is no wonder that Iamblichus wrote that “an innate knowledge about the gods is coexistent with our nature” and that they just *are*, but strangely so. The *loose* way in which I use the term “God” is when I am referring to any divine being and just not being specific enough.

Most of the time, I will refer to other categories of divine beings as spirits or divinities. I will also occasionally refer to ancestors. There may even be a triad of *Gods, spirits, and ancestors* in some of these materials.

What are the definitions you have heard for the term *God*? How do they differ from what I have said?

Try looking up the divine beings in a variety of traditions. What are the similarities? Differences? How well does the term *God* fit what you see?

## Mindset Lessons from Plato

Speaking as someone who comes at worshipping many Gods from Platonism, there is a passage from Plato's *Laws* that deftly captures the differences between theistic and atheistic mindsets. 

This is the first time I'm taking a deep dive into Plato in *The Soul's Inner Statues*, so here is some much-needed context. Plato's *Laws* is a long city-soul analogy that describes how parts of the soul function in an embodied context, and it was questionably complete when Plato died — some parts of it seem rushed, and some analogies that are stridently hammered through by the speakers in later books are not as deftly scaffolded in as they are in Plato's other works.

Plato's works (apart from his letters) take the form of dialogues — dramatic vignettes in which speakers encounter one another and ask questions, usually featuring Socrates. The *Laws* does not include Socrates as a speaker, but an unidentified old man named the Athenian Stranger, who is doing a pilgrimage hike with two more elderly men. Like the *Republic*, it is long and broken up into many sections. Book 10 of the *Laws* contains a conversation on atheism and piety. The Athenian Stranger says:

> "People [commit offenses] in one of three frames of mind: either lacking the belief [in the Gods] I mentioned; or second, believing that there *are* gods, but that they care nothing for human beings; or third, that they are easily won over by inducements in the form of sacrifice and prayer." Laws 10, 885b

In Platonism, an embodied rational soul has three parts: our thinking part, which can connect to the Gods and that survives death; and an irrational soul divided in two, the emotional and appetitive parts. The irrational soul perishes because our feelings and appetites are contingent on our specific embodiment. Our consciousness, and our self, is lasting. The three types of atheism correspond roughly to the three parts of the soul. A lack of belief in Gods is an intellectual atheism. Believing the Gods do not care or influence us is an atheism of care, an alienation from our own emotionality. Believing they can be swayed by offerings is an atheism of appetite. Proper piety requires unlearning these three traps so we can get out of our own way.

In the *Laws*, the Athenian Stranger discusses the lack of belief in Gods by referencing the planetary bodies and other types of natural-world reference points as a way to jolt someone into reverence. Writing in 2022, as someone with a love of modern astronomy, it was daunting for me at first to read the discussion. At face value, his argument relies on outmoded ways of looking at the cosmos. We do not believe that the Earth is at the center — the planets, Sun, and stars do not orbit us. Our robots have been to the surface of Mars, and they probe the secrets of Venus. We even have the Europa Clipper.

What daunted me is a common problem among many of us in the United States. The dominant form of religion here has a strong anti-science contingent. I was born in the late 1980s and experienced American public schooling in the 1990s and early 2000s. When I was in 9th grade, our biology teacher told the class — a rural school filled with students who had been taught that evolution was hubristic sin against their sacred texts — that he didn't believe in evolution, but he was obligated to teach it, and we had better fill out the state exams in a way that the graders of the exams liked. My family is pagan, and I had been taught a non-Christian form of intelligent design — the divine created the cosmos, but science describes how the cosmos actually operates. In 2001, intelligent design was *also* a hubristic sin to many Christians. It wasn't until a few years later that it became a tool for ultra-conservative Christians to sneak Biblical creationism into school curricula. For a few years, though, it was possible to believe in a divine origin for the cosmos *and* to love and appreciate science, and to do so publicly in intellectual circles, without anyone caring.

When we think about Gods, especially in America, we are living in the shadow of the way Christian religious rhetoric operates in the public sphere. We are living in the wake of that religion's Great Awakenings, most recently in the charismatic and evangelical waves of the mid-20th century with their prosperity gospel, cultivated distrust of science, and weaponized piety. My paternal grandparents gave money to the scam that sent Jim Bakker to jail. Often, our reluctance to engage with the divine is based on an inner fear that we will end up exactly like those toxic people and organizations, or we are driven by the desire for social approval to just not investigate Gods at all.

I choose to read Plato's Athenian Stranger as trying to jolt people into a feeling of reverence based on seeing or contemplating the sublime. When it rains, I sometimes think of the metallic rain on Jupiter and fall into silence in wonder — and it is that smallness, that sense of being tuned into what is common between the worlds, that makes me feel connected to the cosmos. The same patterns exist everywhere. Nothing is exotic, even in its multiform variations.

Let's look at the Iamblichus I quoted in the introduction. Conceding the Gods' existence is “not the right way to put it” — but why? And, “an innate knowledge about the gods is coexistent with our nature, and is superior to all judgment and choice, reasoning and proof” and “[t]his knowledge is united from the outset with its own cause and exists in tandem with the essential striving of the soul towards the Good” (De mysteriis, trans. Clarke et al., 2013, I.3) — but how? And do all of us really feel that way, deep down? If we still ourselves, progressing from the turbulence of our daily lives to rest in stillness, will knowledge of Gods just flow forth?

The Gods are not their myths, and they crown the totality of the cosmos, not just Earth. They are the preface to existence, and what they have lain down forms the scaffolding of everything we see in the universe. The universe itself is a Goddess. She expresses her order in a beautiful array of mathematical brilliance, in both the mundane everyday of our lives and the half-grasped dreams of theoretical physicists. Looking to a physical object like the Moon or a planet (or contemplating a story about diamond expolanets) only anchors us in a distant, still-corporeal thing — unless we use that knowledge of other worlds to jostle ourselves out of our subjective experience.

Believing that the Gods do not care comes from several roots. It is a way of cutting off our emotions and our emotional investment — insulating ourselves from everyday disappointments and coping with the seemingly random horrors that come to pass in our lives. Sometimes, we cultivate this mindset because we believe it is a way to be realistic and logical. The universe is enormous. We are each very small in comparison.

Plato's Athenian Stranger also said something else:

> "The gods are on our side — as also are the guardian spirits — and we in turn are the property of the gods and guardian spirits. What is fatal for us is injustice, and arrogance allied to folly; our salvation is justice, and self-control allied to wisdom, and these are to be found dwelling in the living powers of the gods — though they can also be seen dwelling in us, just a bit — or something very like them." Laws, Book 10, 906b

In the system that Plato built, we are part of the organizational structure of the cosmos. We may be small, but we are each capable of developing agency and learning how to be as good and godlike as possible. Everything we see and touch, including ourselves, is part of the universe and the Gods' collaborative creation of it. Gods, their intermediary spirits, and our guardian spirits, look after the whole and the parts within the whole. It is not conceited for a rose in a garden to know that its caretaker is checking its roots, pruning its leaves, and ensuring it grows well.

Sometimes it's hard to think about the whole. We are living on a small planet in a vast universe. The climate crisis touches each of us. We hear of new horrors every day. Many of us live in less than perfect circumstances. One challenge of the material world is that it has spatial and temporal extent, unlike the levels of reality that ground everything. The cosmos must unfold in time, and the way the pre-cosmic levels — whose components overlap and interpenetrate without spatiality — "freeze" into the material world introduces interference patterns. The evils we experience and the imperfections of the material world are all produced by this. When we incarnate, we make the best choices we can based on the options available to us and our disposition — and, like deciding between a tooth extraction and a root canal, sometimes having a healthy tooth is just not on the table. We can possess realistic awareness of our material surroundings while holding the Gods as good. We also chose to incarnate here, which means that we possess some level of agency that can make the options better or worse for souls that choose lives — including our own — in the future.

Now, let's talk about appetitive atheism, or the belief we can sway the Gods with offerings. Many of us who have looked at *National Geographic* or who have taken any history class know that offerings to Gods are a huge component of many societies. When I originally learned about Ancient Greece and Rome, for example, it was explained that the elaborate systems of offerings were used to goad the Gods into granting us favor — and this idea was backed up in plays, epics, and other written pop culture works from the ancient Mediterranean. There are people who attempt to bribe the Gods to "offset" immoral behavior, like lies and theft, to this day. Believing this is possible means believing that the Gods are *not* good or stable. It means believing that they are just as, or moreso, vulnerable to passions and appetities.

Gods' myths and stories do contain this content frequently — sometimes for shock value, forcing someone to either accept that at face value or look deeper at what the myth is actually saying about how the God impacts the world. For example, Medusa is exiled and transformed by Athene after being raped by Poseidon in Athene's temple. Athene then has a champion hero, Perseus, go to the lair of Medusa to kill her and bring back the head. Athene then adorns this head on her body. Athene is an intellectual, wisdom-filled Goddess. In the Platonic tradition, the soul — before we lose our stability and plunge into generation, the term for the material cosmos — is nourished by brief glimpses of truly real patterns and the Gods. Medusa here represents the soul who has her very being violated during that fall into generation, as we all do, along with our alienation from true philosophy and wisdom. Medusa is often depicted with wings, like a soul. The serpents in her hair represent renewal, the many incarnations the soul must go through, all attached to her reasoning core. Her petrifying gaze renders every living thing around her stone, much as we all fail, in some way or other, to truly see the living beings around us, instead relying on ossified mental images and conceptions. Perseus, as a hero, liberates Medusa from the body and returns the immortal part of her to Athene, her proper guardian, and Medusa becomes harmonious with the Goddess once again through directing her activity in tandem with the warlike Goddess' movements. This interpretative analysis has several further implications that I could ponder: What does it mean to view the descent into generation as negative, given that the above interpretation includes elements of violence and loss? How do we view Medusa's older sisters, who are both immortal in some stories? Does it preserve or present problems to the interpretation? If every God is good, how do we interpret the violence of descent, as a God (Poseidon) presides over that violence?

Contemplating those stories, and wrestling with what they mean, is something that anyone can do, even without a ritual space. It becomes easier to do with time and attentiveness, and depending on which Gods one worships, one may have more or less intricate puzzles to work through. It is rewarding, though, for overcoming a shallow view of myths.

Because the Gods care for us, and because they are more expansive than us, they have a more secure knowledge of what is good for us, anyway. I could pray to the Gods for money, power, and fame, but if it were granted, would it actually be the best thing for me? Probably not. Studies have shown that there are hard limits on the amount of happiness and fulfillment we can achieve through material and social wealth. Many millionaires, celebrities, and rulers are absolutely miserable, moreso than the general population. In another dialogue, the *Phaedrus*, Socrates and Phaedrus pray at the end for good things — a generic prayer that leaves the specifics of what happens up to the God, one that expresses humility about our human knowledge. The generalized prayer accounts for our lack of knowledge about the future.

## Contemplative Practices

Even without setting aside physical space for spiritual practices, it is possible to connect with Gods through contemplative techniques. The title of this primer, *The Soul's Inner Statues*, likely appeals to many people who have tried some form of contemplation or breathwork because the title names the soul and evokes some kind of interior spiritual experience. You may have tried a form of meditation using the Headspace or Calm apps, pranayama techniques in a yoga class, and almost definitely the occasional practice of taking a few deep breaths before or after engaging with something difficult.

### Foundations

If you haven't tried meditation techniques, or if your experiences have not been what you wanted, here is some good news: there are many types of contemplative techniques, not all of which require sitting down and focusing on the breath, and online instructional materials are widely available for many types of practices. Breathwork techniques, chanting phrases, and adopting focal-point-based concentration exercises are some of the most widespread options.

Here are a few resources to get started:

* Anusha Wijeyakumar's *Meditation with Intention: Quick and Easy Ways to Create Lasting Peace* seeks to provide useful foundations for anyone, including those who have experienced hurdles. I took note of her book when I saw praise from people who expressed difficulty meditating with instruction they'd tried before.
* Headspace, Calm, Healthy Minds Program, or another meditation app. Calm and Headspace offer free trials, and Healthy Minds is free. Core features of these apps focus on mindfulness meditation. You may also have access to mental wellness apps like Sanvello (which includes meditation timers) through your workplace or insurance benefits.
* For people interested in Stoicism, try out [Donald Robinson's four Stoic meditation exercises](https://donaldrobertson.name/2018/03/27/four-stoic-meditation-exercises/) [(and here's an archival link)](https://web.archive.org/web/2021*/https://donaldrobertson.name/2018/03/27/four-stoic-meditation-exercises/) or [the meditation app Stoa](https://stoameditation.com/).
* If you're curious about contemplative activities in Platonism (again, this is my bias), I recommend Mindy Mandell's *Discovering the Beauty of Wisdom*, which contains some contemplative techniques.
* David Nowakowski has made [a primer on techniques available on his website](https://davidnowakowski.net/meditation/), and I recommend reading those resources. [(Here's an archival link.)](https://web.archive.org/web/2021*/https://davidnowakowski.net/meditation/) 

To time a meditation, you can use a dedicated phone app, the timer on your a watch or fitness tracker, the timer function in your clock app (with a non-jarring timer noise), or even a classic physical timer. Headspace and other paid apps have trials that you can use if you want some guided direction when just starting out. 

When starting a contemplative practice, I recommend having a plan: Know when you will do it, which tool you will use to time it, and the technique(s) you will use during the brief period.

### Contemplating the Divine

I do daily meditation as basic mental hygiene, as do many people — ten-minute shower, ten minute-meditation, and my body and mind are ordered and ready to face the world. If we want to reach inside and open the gate to the statues within, and rest in the Gods who wait just beyond our breath, we need a divine set of focal points instead.

#### Contemplating the Divine Being

Instead of focusing on your breath, you might focus on a deity, household spirit, or ancestor you want to connect with — and don't worry if you don't know *who* quite yet. 

This can be made a bit easier by using an image. If you have a smartphone, put your phone in airplane mode and make sure you have a few images in your photos. Create a dedicated folder so you can find them easily. My Android phone has a feature that keeps the phone on when I'm looking at it, and if yours can do similar, all you have to do is pull up one of those photos and make sure your phone can see you. You could also purchase a bookmark or postcard featuring the deity, use a printout image, or invest in artisinal divine images. We'll talk about those things later — do not look at Etsy quite yet. It works well if the deity is looking out of the image towards you because you have the illusion of eye contact. 

While focusing on the deity, just breathe. You can close your eyes if you like while holding the image in your mind. Using your meditation or phone timer is useful here.

Often, when I meditate on a God, I start with prayer beads. Because I do not craft, I have purchased these beads, often from sellers on Etsy or another site for small businesses and artisans. The beads that work best for me for most contemplations are short strings with between nine and twenty beads. I have selected short phrases from content I have come across for various Gods, and I have pored through other texts to find short snippets that I want to use in some other cases. A few sets of prayer beads I purchased came with prayers, and I use those prayers (with modifications). After chanting for several minutes, I come into stillness while maintaining mental focus on the God.

Sometimes, I don't start with prayer beads. I start by reading a poem (often, a hymn translation) for the God or thinking about aspects of the Gods in epithets and culture before I drop into stillness. I find that this is grounding — like the image, it improves my focus.

#### Contemplating a Text

You could contemplate a myth or other text. This could be done in a traditional meditation, with a pen and paper at a desk, or at a computer — just airplane your phone and ensure that you are difficult to contact while you're working through your thoughts. 

Say a small, heartfelt prayer to the God(s) in the myth. Read the passage you want to work with and jot down what comes to mind. Highlight any passages you want to spend extra attention on, and pause whenever inspiration strikes. You can come back to the same story many times. You can use specific passages from your notes as seeds for a seated meditation. Sometimes, if you alternate between taking notes on myths and contemplating a divine image, elements of the myth will arise spontaneously in the mind while you are doing the seated meditation on the divine being.

#### Breathwork and Adapted Meditation Techniques

For those who have exposure and practice with other forms of meditation, doing pranayama or using traditional meditation techniques can sometimes be adapted to a contemplative spiritual practice like this. 

Sometimes, I do breath of fire (kapalbhati) before contemplating a God. I do meditative visualizations in which sunlight, starlight, or moonlight are filling the body, depending on the context — honoring the solstice or full moon, for example. 

There are also techniques called "grounding and centering" that I learned growing up in which a person envisions that they are rooted into the ground like a tree, drawing up nourishment from the Earth, and drawing down energy from the sun or sun and stars as the centerpoint of this structure. It can be beneficial to do techniques like that if one is feeling scattered and distracted.

## Ritual Practices

Ritual practices are everywhere in contemporary culture — glossy checkout magazines, online-only publications offering the gamut of self-care options, pop culture spirituality blogs, mainstream occult practices, corporate cultish bonding exercises, and so on. The app I currently use for personal development (the Fabulous App) calls my morning, workday, and evening routines “rituals” — and there wasn't even a preexisting option for adding “prayer” to a routine.

In *The Soul's Inner Statues*, we will use “ritual” to mean the activities we do to connect with Gods, divinities, and those who have come before us. A ritual in this context is a set of routine practices we use when engaging in this type of activity.

It is possible to pray without something being a ritual. Sometimes, when I am outside after work in the winter, I see the rising full moon, and I often murmur a quick prayer. There is no ritual involved in that spontaneous reverence.

## Hearth, home, and ancestors

Who you pray to out of affinity — this God, that Goddess, someone else — are often like friendships that change and fade over time. A few are continuous, and many are transient. Household worship is very different because you live somewhere. Even if you are in a liminal space — without a home, living in a dorm, or traveling — there are Gods who preside over liminal spaces who can be deeply enriching to pray to.

The core element of household worship is making offerings to household Gods, often a hearth Goddess and one or more divinities who preside over things like property, storerooms, or abundance. Examples of these divinites are the Lares and Penates (Roman), house wights (various places), Agathos Daimon (Greek, meaning “good spirit/intermediary”), Tykhe or Fortuna (Greek and Roman), the Kitchen God (Chinese folk religion), or a household-focused aspect of a God. Every God technically is a unique perspective on the entirety of everything, so technically speaking, you could worship any of them as your household God. However, the specific expressions of how a God is or was worshipped are very powerful expressions of how that God operates in the world, especially if you have never worshipped them before. Some Gods with well-established household aspects, like Apollon, Zeus, and Hermes, have specific household functions — Zeus of the storeroom, for example, is literally the God who keeps your cozy duvet inserts and tea safe; Apollon of the Streets protects public spaces and harmonizes the home with the exterior world through the threshold boundary. Hermes, as a liminal God, is highly relevant to boundaries.

Household worship can involve acknowledging ancestors of affinity or heritage. Depending on your ancestry and your relationship with said ancestors, household worship could involve some syncretism. For example, I pray to several hearth Goddesses right now: Frigg (Nordic), Nantosuelta and Brigando (both Celtic-Gaulish), and Hestia (Greek). I primarily worship Gods of the Greek pantheon despite not being Greek, and years after I started worshipping Hellenic Gods, I started exploring what it would be like to pray to deities related to my roots. Frigg was a certainty; less is known about the religious spheres of Gaulish Gods, so Nantosuelta and Brigando are more like a fact-finding mission based on things I've seen others do. It's okay to do fact-finding or to not be sure when one is just starting out — or even to revisit long-held practices that one never worked through systematically before.

For reflection:

1. Do you already know of any hearth deities? What about home divinities? 
2. Who interests you the most? Look them up. Alternatively, [look at this list of hearth deities from around the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_deity#List) — I'm using a Wikipedia link because it's most accessible, but there are definitely cultures that are not represented in this incomplete list.

### Home in an age of apartments and transience

Household worship, from a practical standpoint, can be very simple. I have maintained a sacred space in my living area since I was twelve or so. In eighth grade, I made a bench in shop class that became my small floor-level shrine until I went to college, when I lived in the dorms. Incense and candles were forbidden for fire safety reasons, but I often had a small space on my bookshelf that was marked as "sacred" — even if I often neglected it. As most young adult students do, I moved a lot: dorm room to dorm room, apartment to apartment, between my family's home and transient student spaces.

### Worship without being creepy about heritage

In Rumi's "[The Guest House](https://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poem/guest-house/)," the poet frames our lives as transitory places:

>This being human is a guest house.  \
>Every morning a new arrival.

>A joy, a depression, a meanness,  \
>some momentary awareness comes  \
>as an unexpected visitor.

Even before I read that poem, I had been contemplating the idea of our lives as temporary places often — as someone who reads Plato and who holds to Platonic teachings about reincarnations, our families, lineages, and personal contexts change from lifetime to lifetime. There is no steadiness in them. Pardoxically, in Plato and the Platonists, there is a strong emphasis on meeting the context of your current life where it is and paying your respect to Gods and ancestors. This is a lot like being a guest in someone's house: the family may last a long time, and the people, but you will not be there forever, and you need to leave the family better than you found it.

When I started to embark on incorporating ancestral practices, it was important to me to do it without being creepy — it's contextual to this lifetime, after all. The goal for anyone in incorporating such practices is to ensure that one is not neglecting important divinities and Gods, and reaching out to ancestral deities is also an act of repair for those of us whose ancestors ruptured ties to Gods by converting to an evangelizing, one-true-way religion. In the popular TV series *The Good Place*, interpersonal obligations were built up through the phrase "what do we owe each other?" — also the title of a philosophical book that presumably is also working through what our web of connections and obligations mean. The way it played out on the TV show involved characters learning etiquette and mutual respect. 

Because we are worshipping Gods and divinities who are individuals and not archetypes, an analogy can be drawn to reaching out to family after an estrangement you inherited from your parents — it may be awkward, it may fail, but it's worth it to try. For example, if one's ancestors lived in areas where they likely had a Lararium (a household shrine for the Lares) eighteen hundred years ago, reestablishing one could be a good step. If your family has lived in an area where people had Lararia eighteen hundred years ago, but you ultimately trace your roots elsewhere, you should also feel empowered to explore having one — you live there. The same goes for many former colonies — in America, almost all of us trace our cultural history to what was going on in Britain four hundred to two hundred years ago when they were an imperial power taking everything from everybody. Those of us (non-Greek) Americans who worship Greek Gods do so because British people really liked them during the Renaissance and Early Modern period, and fluency in Greek literature and its motifs proved someone was cultured even after the texts started to be translated into English. Greece is 1800 miles away from England.

If we want to set boundaries between ourselves and absolutism and intolerance, changing one's worldview to repair such rifts can work wonders. Obviously, there will be some times when the answer is no.

In the *Phaedrus* commentary taken down by Hermias during one of the Platonist Syrianus' lectures fifteen hundred years ago, the text comments that someone will often reincarnate into a family to resolve injustices from generations ago. When we incarnate, we pick what is best for our soul given our options. This can include repairing such ruptures, all the while knowing that we may not even be in the group that benefits from these activities next lifetime.

Being healthy about ancestral traditions is healthy when it comes out of a desire to do what is just and to repair what was broken. We should ask ourselves *how, why, and whom* as prompts to deepen our practice without succumbing to hate, division, and false senses of superiority. Questions like these can also heal a disorienting sense of unplacing when they are approached from a place of compassion, fierce honesty, and care, and while the answers may create some very personalized practices, it will be a personalized ritual practice that is solidly grounded in piety according to what is most just in each person or family's specific case.


## Practice

In the introduction, I recommended clearing off a shelf or small space to use for a household shrine. During Chapter One's practice, you will make use of this space.

Sometimes, no matter what, we run into challenges setting aside space. If you live in a college town, May is a great time to find tables and shelves cheaply (or for free), as students are leaving, and many of them are on tight deadlines. FreeCycle and other no-buy groups are other options. If this is not possible, make space on your floor or wall that you can dedicate to the Gods. I found [this post about young South Asians coming to the United States and how they set up their sacred areas to be particularly inspiring for thinking about what one can do with limited space](https://web.archive.org/web/20220103123537/https://religionnews.com/2021/10/13/millennial-hindus-get-creative-with-home-temples-in-cramped-apartments/?utm_source=pocket_mylist).

If you are unable to establish a permanent shrine space, create a folder on your smartphone with images of the hearth Goddesses and divinities of interest to you. Turn on the phone feature that keeps the phone screen on when you're looking at it. Put the phone on a stand on a clean surface, full-screen the image after airplaning your phone, and offer prayers in front of the image.

What you place in your household shrine depends on what you can afford. Appendix I contains some recommendations for different budgets.

You need:

* Something for pouring liquid.
* Something to pour liquid into.
* The name of the deity you're worshipping (post-it note or something fancier).

That's it.

Often, especially when we're looking at ritual space stock photography or the spaces of people who have committed disposable income to pricier items, we see beautiful statuary and intricate spaces. This helps, but it's not necessary – and, given the climate crisis, it makes sense to be deliberate about purchases instead of contributing to overconsumption. Once you have a good idea that you want to worship someone and have maintained the habit for long enough, go ahead and think about images.

The bare minimum you need for worshipping someone is their name. In antiquity, when people were pouring libations and making sacrifices on altars, the altar was marked with the name of the God or Gods. It is like having something in the *to:* field.

For a hearth Goddess, I also recommend a small candle or flame representation. You can use either a traditional lighter or a rechargeable electric lighter. Some people even use electric candles! There are phone apps that simulate fires and candles, too.

For a libation, any drink is fine — or you could offer plain water. I buy loose dried tulsi and make a concentrate that I store in the refrigerator. Whenever I want to pray, I pour some into the libation jar I use and add water. I also offer a flavored water concentrate that I like, especially to my ancestral Gods — it feels very intimate to share something that I drink every day. Some people offer wine or other alcoholic beverages. I find that I don't go through the bottles quickly enough to use up all of the alcohol before it goes off, and since I rarely drink, it feels odd to give Gods something that isn't part of my diet.

Other types of offerings include incenses, flowers, and food. If you use incense, be careful of resins — do not burn them indoors on charcoal disks, as there is a carbon monoxide risk. Burning resins outdoors occasionally is fine. Stick and cone incenses are great for daily indoor use, and some companies have low-smoke incenses. If you use essential oils in an oil diffuser in your offering space, please check that your oil is pet-safe if you have animals — vets have been more public in recent years about what to choose and avoid. Never use citrus oils around your cat.

Disposing of offerings can be done in a clean sink (for libations) or in your household trash. If you offer food or flowers, the most respectful way to put them in your waste receptacle is to wrap them in paper (like a used grocery bag from the time you forgot your reusable bags) and add them to the trash just before you put it out curbside. If you can compost, that is preferred, but don't worry if you can't — I, too, live in an apartment without that option. If you offer non-fresh goods like dried flowers, rotating them out after six months to a year is auspicious — especially if you do it at about the time of the winter or summer solstice.

If you are setting up a permanent space, be respectful. Never use it for random objects, and encourage any family members or roommates to avoid putting anything there that isn't an offering.

### Household Prayer

Hopefully, you now have a shelf or other location where you can create a pop-up prayer space. If you have purchased or gathered any items, now is the time to place them there. Clean them, dry them, and arrange them in an ergonomically useful way.

Before praying, I recommend washing your hands. If you are praying after your daily shower, congratulations, you have just discovered habit-stacking.

If you have a candle or other flame representation, light it or turn it on. Keep your elbows at your sides and hold out your forearms with your hands palm-up. Standing up is the common practice, although one can sit if necessary.

Say something like:

> I honor and acknowledge the household Gods, [insert any specific names]. I give you this offering of [whatever you're offering].

Make the offering. If you are doing a libation, this means pouring whatever you have chosen to offer into the bowl. Sometimes, after offering most of something, a person will take a sip of the remainder. 

Take a pause and a few deep breaths.

If you are honoring specific Gods and spirits and know anything about them, this is the time to call to mind those aspects. For Nantosuelta, for example, one might think of her connection to beehives, fire, and Earth — far from just being a Goddess of the home, she has many areas of affinity.

Sometimes, people will recite poems they've found about the deities and divinities they're worshipping, play music, or speak from the heart about what they have going on in their lives. You could do that now if you like.

When done, say:

> Thank you, [insert any specific names or just say "household God(s)"]. May you bless me, my family, my friends, and my communities with whatever is most good, fitting, and appropriate.

Dispose of the offering in a few hours. I like to clean out my offering bowls after I've done dishes in the evening.


### Meditation

This meditation is based on an exercise from one of Plotinus' *Enneads* and on something I've done since I was a teenager.

The passage from Plotinus' *Enneads* is from 5.8.9, and here's how it is translated by Gerson (and note that the pronoun “he” is used for the God, but this could be any deity regardless of gender):

> “So, let us grasp by discursive thinking this cosmos all together as one, each of its parts remaining what it is and not jumbled together, if possible, so that if any one of these should occur to us – for example, the sphere outside the periphery of the cosmos – an image of the sun follows immediately and together with it all the other stars, and earth and sea and all the living beings are seen, as if all these were in reality to be seen in a transparent sphere. Let there be formed in your soul, then, the image of a luminous sphere having all things in it, whether moving or stable, or some moving and some stable.  \
>“Keeping this image, take another for yourself by abstracting the mass from it. Abstract, too, places and the semblance of the matter you have in yourself. Don’t try to take another sphere smaller than it in mass, but call on the god who made that of which you have a semblance, and pray for him to come. And he might come bearing his cosmos with all of the gods in it, being one and all of them, and each is all coming together as one, each with different powers, though all are one by that multiple single power. Rather, it is that one god who is all. For he lacks nothing, if all those gods should become what they are. They are all together and each is separate, again, in indivisible rest, having no sensible shape – for if they had, one would be in one place, and one in another, and each would not have all in himself. Nor do they have different parts in different places, nor all in the identical place, nor is each whole like a power fragmented, being quantifiable, like measured parts. It is rather all power, extending without limit, being unlimited in power. And in this way, the god is great, as the parts of it are all unlimited. For where could one say that he is not already present?”

For this prayer, place a chair or cushion near your shrine to use as a meditation seat. Make a short prayer:

> I pray to the Gods and give you this offering before my meditation. Be well disposed.

If you have an offering, make it now, and then be seated.

For this meditation, start off by doing a body scan, eyes closed or open. Start the scan at the top of your head, working through parts of the body to see what is comfortable or uncomfortable. Notice the pressure of gravity where you are seated.

Once you have finished the body scan, turn your attention to the boundary between your skin and the air. Envision your awareness expanding from your body and into the room around you. Feel the furniture and become aware of the life within your home's biome. From there, expand your awareness steadily to every room in your home or apartment. If you are in an apartment, expand your awareness to the entire building.

From your building, steadily come to encompass the neighborhood, then the city, and finally your region. Allow your awareness to expand in gradients until you are holding the world in your mind. Examine the differences in climate and ground cover, sunlight levels and depth of night. Rest here for a moment.

When you are ready, expand it outward from the Earth to the Earth-Moon system. Grow through the void to reach the planets of the inner solar system and the Sun, then the asteroid belt and the outer planets, and finally the mass of smaller bodies that make up the frozen fringes of the solar system. Expand your awareness to the nearest star systems, then to the galaxy. Know that we are in a network of galaxies, and expand into that. Eventually, your awareness will encompass all of the honeycombed web of the universe. It is vast in its voids and light oases.

All of this has evolved in time, and it came from a point of indescribably high density. The visible universe was once about the size of a grapefruit. You are containing at least all of this within your awarness.

Now, think of all that you are holding within your mind, and call to mind what it would be without mass. Call to mind all that is, and then imagine it spaceless. Contract all that you have become aware of without giving it mass, shape, or extent in time. Beyond the spatial extent, beyond time, and beyond bodies, there is an inflection point of divinity. As Plotinus wrote so long ago, ask for the God to come.

Whatever comes to your awareness, rest with it until you judge the meditation to be finished. Thank the Gods and put back your chair or cushion.

This exercise is a bit different from what is happening in Plotinus' Ennead 5.8.9, as it fuses the abstraction of his words and their beauty with an expansion into everything visible around us. It can be a powerful visualization practice.
