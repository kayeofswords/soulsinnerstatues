This chapter is titled *Foundations* because we will dive a bit deeper into thinking about Gods. It is also titled *Foundations* because the main practice at the end of this chapter involves the cleared-off section of shelf and small bowl I mentioned in the introduction.

Specifically, we will look at what Gods actually are, and we will use Plato's *Laws* to unpack the differences between theism and atheism. We will then consider the foundations of contemplative practices, ritual practices, and household observances. Finally, you will have an opportunity to do some brief veneration on your own.

While explaining these things, I will ask you questions. One option when encountering these questions? Write out the answers, either longhand or in a text editor. Other options? If you are a parent, beholden to one or more demanding jobs with no work-life balance, or writing is just not accessible right now, that's okay. Think about these questions while you are in the shower, during your commute, or when completing tasks that don't require a heavy cognitive load. If something comes up that you want to keep hold of for later, use a note-taking app on your phone or create a draft email that you will send to yourself.

## What is a God, Anyway?

In the Introduction, I quoted from two philosophers who were operating in a similar cultural context to each other. Thales, who was active before Socrates’ lifetime (and is thus called a "Presocratic"), said that the world is full of Gods; Iamblichus, a Syrian fluent in both his native culture and Greek culture of the late third century of our common era, described a God's existence as a given, but *strangely* so. 

Not once did I bring up the predomiant understanding of the word *God* in the modern era, which is often regared as a *specific* someone — an omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient being who is often tied to the initiatory rites of revealed religions, a being only accessible when someone adheres to the correct holy book and prophet(s). Sometimes in spirituality circles, people refer to the Source, Spirit, or the One,  My reluctance to bring this up is partly related to my own background — my outlook on the Gods is Platonizing, which means that I do not believe that the first principle is capable of being described in that way. This is not a book about Platonic reverence for the Gods even though my bias is definitely at play. My second reason for *not* bringing it up in the introduction was that doing so would set an inappropriate tone for this work. My third reason is that I want to push back against the totalizing understanding of words like god, deity, or divinity.

*God* is used as a class term for a wide range of divine persons, sometimes accurately, sometimes imprecisely. Often, the term is used when translating indigenous terms for divine beings. The word *spirit* is used just as often. The Shinto term *Kami*, for example, describes a range of beings, with many of them more reminiscent of divinities like nymphs, river deities, or house wights. The words *theos* and *daimon* in Greek are equally problematic. A daimon is an intermediary spirit that carries out specific functions, but sometimes, a God is called a daimon in the source texts! River divinities are usually referred to with *theos*, but are they a *theos* in the same way the Goddess Athene is? Which, if any, beings from another language receive the term “God”? “Spirit”? “Wight”? It depends on the biases of who is translating and if they have a specific set of beings in mind when they choose a word. This is one reason why Wikipedia is often not as good as going to a religious organization's website (or, for decentralized religions, a few sites put together by different practitioners who have obvious close cultural ties) to learn about what its adherents believe.

Theological and philosophical exercises can get us down to stricter defintions and classes. In Platonism, these elastic terms have been refined into four classes: gods, angels, daimones, and heroes. The final three classes can be grouped under “daimones.” Each of the daimonic classes has less contact with the ultimate divine reality and more contact with variability and change. Divinities of the natural world and household inhabit the spaces “closest” to us. You and I are souls that incarnate in material bodies according to a long, regular cycle; a small sliver of us is permanent and divine like them, and that is what we want to cultivate as *I* in a spiritual practice. Other philosophical schools, like Yogic philosophy, Stoicism, or Daoist philosophy, have different takes on this.

The *strict* definition of God I will take — and the one I mean when I discuss our inner core of happiness and the statues within us — are those individual divine powers who ground the entirety of reality. They slip and slide into one another, boundary-free because they preexist both limit and unlimitedness. They are the ones who we ultimately uncover in our practices. What is visible in breathtaking photographs from a space telescope or witness the powerful fury of the world around us, or even the small actions of our daily lives, are all ultimately grounded in *that* astonishing foundation. It is no wonder that Iamblichus wrote that “an innate knowledge about the gods is coexistent with our nature” and that they just *are*, but strangely so. The *loose* way in which I use the term “God” is when I am referring to any divine being and just not being specific enough.

Most of the time, I will refer to other categories of divine beings as spirits or divinities. I will also occasionally refer to ancestors. There may even be a triad of *Gods, spirits, and ancestors* in some of these materials.

What are the definitions you have heard for the term *God*? How do they differ from what I have said?

Try looking up the divine beings in a variety of traditions. What are the similarities? Differences? How well does the term *God* fit what you see?

## Theism and Atheism

Speaking as someone who comes at worshipping many Gods from Platonism, there is a passage from Plato's *Laws* that deftly captures the differences between theism and atheism. Plato's *Laws* is a long city-soul analogy that describes how parts of the soul function in an embodied context, and it was questionably complete when Plato died — some parts of it seem rushed, and some analogies that are stridently hammered through by the speakers in later books are not as deftly scaffolded in as they are in Plato's other works.

Plato's works (apart from his letters) take the form of dialogues — dramatic vignettes in which speakers encounter one another and ask questions, usually featuring Socrates. The *Laws* does not include Socrates as a speaker, but an unidentified old man named the Athenian Stranger, who is doing a pilgrimage hike with two more elderly men. Like the *Republic*, it is long and broken up into many sections. Book 10 of the *Laws* contains a conversation on atheism and piety. The Athenian Stranger says:

> "People [commit offenses] in one of three frames of mind: either lacking the belief [in the Gods] I mentioned; or second, believing that there *are* gods, but that they care nothing for human beings; or third, that they are easily won over by inducements in the form of sacrifice and prayer." Laws 10, 885b

In Platonism, an embodied rational soul has three parts: our thinking part, which can connect to the Gods and that survives death; and an irrational soul divided in two, the emotional and appetitive parts. The irrational soul perishes because our feelings and appetites are contingent on our specific embodiment. Our consciousness, and our self, is lasting. The three types of atheism correspond roughly to the three parts of the soul. A lack of belief in Gods is an intellectual atheism. Believing the Gods do not care or influence us is an atheism of care, an alienation from our own emotionality. Believing they can be swayed by offerings is an atheism of appetite. Proper piety requires unlearning these three traps so we can get out of our own way.

In the *Laws*, the Athenian Stranger discusses the lack of belief in Gods by referencing the planetary bodies and other types of natural-world reference points as a way to jolt someone into reverence. Writing in 2022, as someone with a love of modern astronomy, it was daunting for me at first to read the discussion. At face value, his argument relies on outmoded ways of looking at the cosmos. We do not believe that the Earth is at the center — the planets, Sun, and stars do not orbit us. Our robots have been to the surface of Mars, and they probe the secrets of Venus.

What daunted me is a common problem among many of us in the United States. The dominant form of religion here has a strong anti-science contingent. I was born in the late 1980s and experienced American public schooling in the 1990s and early 2000s. When I was in 9th grade, our biology teacher told the class — a rural school filled with students who had been taught that evolution was hubristic sin against their sacred texts — that he didn't believe in evolution, but he was obligated to teach it, and we had better fill out the state exams in a way that the graders of the exams liked. My family is pagan, and I had been taught a non-Christian form of intelligent design — the divine created the cosmos, but science describes how the cosmos actually operates. In 2001, intelligent design was *also* a hubristic sin among Christians. It wasn't until a few years later that it became a tool for Christians to sneak Biblical creationism into school curricula. For a few years, though, it was possible to believe in a divine origin for the cosmos *and* to love and appreciate science, and to do so publicly in intellectual circles, without anyone caring.

When we think about Gods, especially in America, we are living in the shadow of the way Christian religious rhetoric operates in the public sphere. We are living in the wake of that religion's Great Awakenings, most recently in the charismatic and evangelical waves of the mid-20th century with their prosperity gospel, cultivated distrust of science, and weaponized piety. My paternal grandparents gave money to the scam that sent Jim Bakker to jail. Often, our reluctance to engage with the divine is based on an inner fear that we will end up exactly like those toxic people and organizations, or we are driven by the desire for social approval to just not investigate Gods at all.

I choose to read Plato's Athenian Stranger as trying to jolt people into a feeling of reverence based on seeing or contemplating the sublime. When it rains, I sometimes think of the metallic rain on Jupiter and fall into silence in wonder — and it is that smallness, that sense of being tuned into what is common between the worlds, that makes me feel connected to the cosmos. The same patterns exist everywhere. Nothing is exotic, even in its multiform variations.

Let's look at the Iamblichus I quoted in the introduction. Conceding the Gods' existence is “not the right way to put it” — but why? And, “an innate knowledge about the gods is coexistent with our nature, and is superior to all judgment and choice, reasoning and proof” and “[t]his knowledge is united from the outset with its own cause and exists in tandem with the essential striving of the soul towards the Good” (De mysteriis, trans. Clarke et al., 2013, I.3) — but how? And do all of us really feel that way, deep down? If we still ourselves, progressing from the turbulence of our daily lives to rest in stillness, will knowledge of Gods just flow forth?

The Gods are not their myths, and they crown the totality of the cosmos, not just Earth. They are the preface to existence, and what they have lain down forms the scaffolding of everything we see in the universe. The universe itself is a Goddess. She expresses her order in a beautiful array of mathematical brilliance, in both the mundane everyday of our lives and the half-grasped dreams of theoretical physicists. Looking to a physical object like the Moon or a planet (or contemplating a story about diamond expolanets) only anchors us in a distant, still-corporeal thing — unless we use that knowledge of other worlds to jostle ourselves out of our subjective experience.

Believing that the Gods do not care comes from several roots. It is a way of cutting off our emotions and our emotional investment — insulating ourselves from everyday disappointments and coping with the seemingly random horrors that come to pass in our lives. Sometimes, we cultivate this mindset because we believe it is a way to be realistic and logical. The universe is enormous. We are each very small in comparison.

Plato's Athenian Stranger also said something else:

> "The gods are on our side — as also are the guardian spirits — and we in turn are the property of the gods and guardian spirits. What is fatal for us is injustice, and arrogance allied to folly; our salvation is justice, and self-control allied to wisdom, and these are to be found dwelling in the living powers of the gods — though they can also be seen dwelling in us, just a bit — or something very like them." Laws, Book 10, 906b

In the system that Plato built, we are part of the organizational structure of the cosmos. We may be small, but we are each capable of developing agency and learning how to be as good and godlike as possible. Everything we see and touch, including ourselves, is part of the universe and the Gods' collaborative creation of it. Gods, their intermediary spirits, and our guardian spirits, look after the whole and the parts within the whole. It is not conceited for a rose in a garden to know that its caretaker is checking its roots, pruning its leaves, and ensuring it grows well.

Sometimes it's hard to think about the whole. We are living on a small planet in a vast universe. The climate crisis touches each of us. We hear of new horrors every day. Many of us live in less than perfect circumstances. One challenge of the material world is that it has spatial and temporal extent, unlike the levels of reality that ground everything. The cosmos must unfold in time, and the way the pre-cosmic levels — whose components overlap and interpenetrate without spatiality — "freeze" into the material world introduces interference patterns. The evils we experience and the imperfections of the material world are all produced by this. When we incarnate, we make the best choices we can based on the options available to us and our disposition — and, like deciding between a tooth extraction and a root canal, sometimes having a healthy tooth is just not on the table. We can possess realistic awareness of our material surroundings while holding the Gods as good. We also chose to incarnate here, which means that we possess some level of agency that can make the options better or worse for souls that choose lives — including our own — in the future.

Now, let's talk about appetitive atheism, or the belief we can sway the Gods with offerings. Many of us who have looked at *National Geographic* or who have taken any history class know that offerings to Gods are a huge component of many societies. When I originally learned about Ancient Greece and Rome, for example, it was explained that the elaborate systems of offerings were used to goad the Gods into granting us favor — and this idea was backed up in plays, epics, and other written pop culture works from the ancient Mediterranean. There are people who attempt to bribe the Gods to "offset" bad behavior, like lies and theft; 

Because the Gods care for us, and because they are more expansive than us, they have a more secure knowledge of what is good for us. I could pray to the Gods for money, power, and fame, but if it were granted, would it actually be the best thing for me? Probably not. Studies have shown that there are hard limits on the amount of happiness and fulfillment we can achieve through material and social wealth. Many millionaires, celebrities, and rulers are absolutely miserable, moreso than the general population. In another dialogue, the *Phaedrus*, Socrates and Phaedrus pray at the end for good things — a generic prayer that leaves the specifics of what happens up to the God, one that expresses humility about our human knowledge.
