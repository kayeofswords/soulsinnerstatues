Throughout the first part of this book, we built up the foundations of ritual practice that you can bring forward into your life. The ritual practices, like most routines, will iterate. You will go through seasons of your life when five minutes *is* all you have and other seasons when you can, and want to, do more. There will be days when showing up at shrine will be the last thing you want to do — maybe you're anxious over an unexpected bill, you've lost a job, or someone in your family is going through a hard time — and other times when you feel the abundant presence of the universe all around you.

Practicing daily rituals and establishing presence with the Gods is slightly different from studying something like religion, theology, or philosophy. Many reading this book may already be thinking of ways to deepen your practice by engaging with learning material, navigating the messy world away from our shrines with integrity, and joining formal or informal group(s). This is the first part of three, and here, we will focus on how to develop your self-directed learning. If you are completely good with your five minutes, the suggestions in this chapter are also adequate for any area of life that you seek to improve.

In your notes on this book, and in your practice thus far, you may have questions. Here are some examples:

* Why is Kaye talking about Platonism? Didn't Plato just write political philosophy? How does this match what I learned in school?
* While praying to Ptah, I came across hymns that used terms unknown to me. What do these mean in Egyptian traditional religion, and how can I build up my knowledge so I understand what I'm reading?
* Stoicism talks about Zeus a lot. Is there a theistic way to approach Stoicism that is different from the Silicon Valley self-help?
* That's a good point about needing to consider honoring Gods associated with yoga if I do yoga. What are ways to approach this that are respectful of South Asian culture?

Before I got really into a Platonizing practice, I had heard from someone that everything I needed to know about the Hellenic Gods is contained within Plato. The first dialogue I read after hearing that, Plato's *Symposium*, was astonishingly different from what was assigned in school — and I wanted to read more. Still, without a committed study habit and with a lot changing in my twenties as I finished school and started working, it was hard to read *anything*, let alone Plato — and the hours I spent on social media didn't help. It wasn't until my late twenties when I left Facebook that I started to rediscover my focus and mental energy.

## Content Is Written By People

Generally speaking, there are two types of content you will engage with when you are trying to learn more: academic content and practitioner content. Some academics also worship many Gods (and sometimes the Gods they study), but due to pressures in academia, it can be hard to figure out who they are unless you start talking to people. 

Academic content is most frequently released in the form of journal articles, books (jargon term: scholarly monographs), or gray literature (think PowerPoint slides and conference talk notes). Practitioner content may be in the form of social media posts, blogs and short manuals, and published books. Both academics and practitioners will post lectures to YouTube and other platforms.

One challenge with *any* content in the present century is the politically-charged, polarized atmosphere. For example, content on Nordic Gods is divided between extreme right-wing groups with white supremacist associations and extremely progressive material. The right-wing materials put money into the pockets of people who are harming nonwhite American citizens. The extremely progressive material may assume that you are only one awakening away from becoming a Marxist-anarchist, but it's a more ethically sound financial investment. I usually Google an author's name to see what comes up and avoid people and publishing houses that ring alarm bells, and I do the same with Etsy purchases.

Another challenge is the tendency for people to be pressured to monetize content in order to get by and make rent, especially with today's wealth inequalities — often before that person has enough mastery of the material to be ready to provide a spiritual service to others. The Internet is filled with people who got into something 10 months ago and are trying to make money off of it. We always need to put the spiritual wellness and integrity of the ones we are teaching *first* in any learning environment, as being in an teacher/student relationship means that the recipient of a teaching has invested care of their soul's development in *us*. It's not to be taken lightly or carelessly. Conversely, someone may have a PhD in a topic related to the Gods or initiatory training in a specific tradition, and another person may have spent 20-30 years experimentally working through a practice without much in the way of training or initiation (although, truth be told, nothing happens in a vacuum). In library science, we call this "authority is constructed and contextual" (an information literacy frame as put out by American College and Research Libraries, also known as ACRL). 

If you are engaging with informal content (like a blog), be sure to check someone's About page and their blog's first few posts. Usually, bloggers will write an origin story at some point to talk about where they started from, and even if that origin story is a decade old on their Wordpress (meaning you don't know where that person is at now without reading their bio for their more recent activities), it gives you valuable information about them. I've changed how I present myself significantly over the past few years due to an increased awareness of and desire to respect modern Hellenes/Greeks. While I have zero expertise in how a Greek person mediates their Hellenic identity, whichever God or Gods they worship, or what worshipping Gods means to them as an individual, I am building up what a theistic cultural reception of the Hellenic Gods can look like in America when it's done tactfully, so that's where I focus my attention. That's in my bio, but the first post on my blog is something I wrote in my mid-to-late 20s about my values and practice, which looked very different at the time.

## Finding Book Reviews

If you Google an author's name or a book title with the phrase "book review" (with the quotes around "book review"), you will find reviews that Google has indexed beyond just what's on Amazon. If you don't have ideas for a specific book, just put in a topic (such as divination, worshipping Kemetic Gods, Shiva in yoga, prayers for Gods).

Many of the books in the Google results will be worth reading, although it's good to know an author's perspective before you jump into their work.

## Using the Library

Library access can be found at the local, state, and national levels. You may also have access to the library of the institution where you work or study. Your state library will license resources for the entire state to use remotely — it's worth knowing what those resources are. The same goes for your local library.

When you visit your library's website, also check their policies on interlibrary loan and item delivery between libraries in the same state system. Interlibrary loan is often no-fee at academic institutions, but some local and state libraries will apply a fee to using it to offset the costs. Simialrly, item delivery between locations may either be free or have a nominal fee.

### Do You Have Alum JSTOR Access?

At least in the United States, many people who have graduated from college have graduated from institutions that provide alum access to JSTOR. Look at your alum website, and if you can't find anything about that, contact the library.

## My Plan for Plato

This is the advice that, after several years studying Platonism-related topics, I would give to someone embarking on an in-depth study.

If one has heard that Platonists were spiritual sages in antiquity — say, from Linda Johnsen's *Lost Masters: Sages of Ancient Greece*, one may attempt to dive directly into Plotinus like I did when I was in my early 20s and have a disorienting and awful experience. No matter how exciting an author seems, starting with the fundamentals is crucial to understanding what is going on at all. 

So. I bought one of those giant books with every work by Plato and started reading.

That was also a mistake.

The breakthrough happened when I learned that there was such a thing as [a Plato reading order](https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199935314.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199935314-e-28#:~:text=According%20to%20Iamblichus%2C%20for%20example,and%20finally%20Timaeus%20and%20Parmenides.). There is a modern, which-one-did-he-write-when order (which I don't recommend), and there are several systematic treatments that were used in the ancient world when reading Plato — one with a lot of dialogues and another with a selection. The selection of dialogues is the Iamblichean reading order, named for Iamblichus, a Syrian Platonist who was instrumental for reinvigorating traditional religious practice through the careful application of Platonic doctrine. We have surviving information about this in his *De Mysteriis*. There are ten dialogues: Alcibiades I, Gorgias, Phaedo, Cratylus, Theaetetus, Sophist, Statesman, Phaedrus, Symposium, Philebus, Timaeus, and Parmenides.

At first, I read the dialogues on their own, and I reached the *Symposium* with that method. I picked up one of the Platonic commentaries (the one by Hermias on Syrianus' *Phaedrus* lectures) by happenstance and discovered that its exegesis of the material was extremely useful and groundbreaking. However, when I read the *Parmenides* commentary, I felt like the rug had been pulled out from under me because my understanding of the rungs on the ladder from the One to Matter was almost nonexistent in any meaningful way. I continued reading Platonic texts and found some helpful modern scholars' work at good price points that helped me understand the metaphysics a bit more. I also started listening to the Secret History of Western Esotericism podcast (despite not identifying as an esotericist) because its episodes on Plato were very helpful. I read the Parmenides before the Timaeus and only read the Timaeus after the Republic and Laws, which I added due to never having read them. At about that time, I realized that there was no one correct reading order for the commentaries and that swallowing them down as simultaneously as possible would give me the best rough outline. The pandemic happened all of a sudden (when I was reading the Laws), and spiritual Platonists started posting content to YouTube — Tim Addey, Mindy Mandell — and I found other content from Pierre Grimes. The combination of reading, audio, and visual content was extremely helpful. I also found some virtual groups to be active in, all based on Zoom, and a few people I knew on social media were extremely helpful and generous with their time when I had questions. I continued — and continue — swallowing down commentaries and other Platonic writings.

What I would encourage, based on my experience, is to read Alcibiades I, Gorgias, and the Phaedo. Then, stop reading those and pick up Radek Chlup's *Proclus*, which introduces key elements of the system. Take note of the tables included in those. Several articles by Danielle Layne contain better tables, and [Edward Butler wrote an article for a general audience on the polycentricity of the Gods](https://www.academia.edu/30296722/_Polycentric_Polytheism_pp._37-40_in_Witches_and_Pagans_32_June_2016) that can be used to help drive those concepts home. Deviate from this to read Iamblichus' *On the Mysteries/De Mysteriis*, which will help ground all of the cereberal in practical prayer and attentiveness to the Gods. Ensuring that one maintains an active prayer practice while learning is absolutely crucial to gaining insights.

Read the Alcibiades I again, this time in conjunction with one of the commentaries (remember: interlibrary loan) — Proclus and Olympiodorus both wrote on it. Read Tim Addey's *The Unfolding Wings*, Sallust's *On the Gods and the World*, and Mindy Mandell's *Discovering the Beauty of Wisdom*. For podcasts, listen to the Secret History of Western Esotericism from the beginning, The History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps' early episodes, and look up any podcast interviews with Gregory Shaw or Edward Butler. From there, read the Gorgias and its commentary, the Phaedo and its commentaries, and continue in that fashion for the dialogues that have surviving commentaries until you reach the Parmenides. For the Parmenides, first read Aristotle's *Metaphysics* and Syrianus' response to it, then read the Parmenides alongside Proclus' commentary. While reading the commentaries, cycle to treatises from Plotinus as they are mentioned in footnotes and endnotes. The *Elements of Theology* and *Platonic Theology* are useful to approach now, as are any other texts by Aristotle you may be interested in (or not). Read Plotinus' *Enneads* and any of Proclus' essays or Damascius' other works. It's all an iterative process, and once one has the trunk fairly solid, the branches may grow where they take you closer to the light.

If you're just curious about the philosophical system and do not want the deep details, reading something like *Discovering the Beauty of Wisdom* alongside the Alcibiades I, Phaedo, Apology, and Phaedrus will get you a decent idea. I recommend that anyone read Iamblichus' *On the Mysteries*, though. To be perfectly frank, whenever I got discouraged writing this primer on worshipping Gods because it seemed daunting or I doubted my relevance, skill, or capacity, I just thought back to Iamblichus to anchor and guide me. Almost everything we need to know about honoring the Gods is in Iamblichus.

## Creating Your Plan

The above may have been overwhelming. For one, Platonism involves reading a lot of scholarly monographs — someone studying Nordic concepts of the soul or divination or modern devotional poetry will skew their reading more towards practitioners' publications. If you are studying Stoicism, the modern popularization has made it so accessible that Stoics even have their own meditation app, and Platonism is still lagging behind.

Here is what I hope you took away from the prior section on getting more familiar with Platonism:

* Choose multiple formats. Audio, video, and writing are all represented above.
* While starting out with a survey book of a topic may be ideal, you do actually need a sense of the material itself. In the example above, my advice to read a few dialogues before getting into other types of material is based on that premise.
* You don't need to have it figured out all at once. As I wrote above, I read Plotinus when a treatise of his came up in the translator's notes. You can use the works cited by someone to build out your reading list.
* Learning can be overwhelming, and it pushes us outside of our comfort zones. That's why it's learning. During the lowest points, do what you can to ease the discomfort and remember why you're doing this.

Above all, keep your plan realistic. If you have half an hour a day to study between when you put your kids to bed and when you want to spend time with your spouse — or if you know that your only alone time at home will be when you wash the dishes with headphones in — do not choose a plan that is unrealistic about the formats you need or the reading speed you have. If you have a condition that impacts your focus or stamina, put your health first and seek out advice from others with similar conditions about how they build time for learning and personal enrichment into their lives.

If you frequently use social media, it's likely that your attention span will have deteriorated from when you were younger. Consider doing a social media fast for a few days while you start up your new habit. If you frequently binge-watch shows, reducing your screen time to 1-2 episodes per day can improve you experience of the show and give you some much-needed reading time, as research shows binge-watching can reduce the amount of enjoyment we get out of savoring new episodes.

Put your audiobook and ebook apps on your phone's home screen and hide everything that isn't reading material. Ensure that books you need to read are located within arm's reach on the couch for when your cat sits on you and you cannot move.

Here are some guidelines for getting the most out of your learning plan:

* While you read, take notes. Keep a notebook or write in the margins so you can roll around in the text and react to what you're reading. If you are using ebooks, export the notes when you are done so you can review them.
* Celebrate small wins. When you have finished something tricky, do something nice for yourself — put on your favorite song and dance, give yourself a hug, or say something good about yourself in the mirror.
* Never underestimate exercise. I've found that doing some exercise in the early evening helps me bounce back from mental fatigue — something as simple as a walk or a few sun salutations.
* Build on what you're learning. Start writing essays about things that interest you. You're not being graded.

While you are studying, you will likely come across courses (free and paid), reading groups, and other ways to learn from experts. Take advantage of the opportunities that are affordable to you, and don't assume that a higher cost equals a better learning experience. Be wary about becoming a “groupie” for a specific expert — direct devotion at the Gods, not at human beings, and always be aware that the ones you are learning from are humans with merits and flaws. If someone is trying to induce the fear of missing out (FOMO) in their marketing materials, be suspicious. They probably don't have the exclusive knowledge they're claiming to possess.

## Excercise: Create A Content List

Brainstorm a topic that you want to know more about, ideally related to worshipping Gods. Identify content items that you can engage with to learn more about it. They could be books, videos, podcasts, courses — you name it. Look up reviews for the books and learn more about the podcast, video, and book creators. Narrow the resources down to five.

Then, find learning time in your schedule — one or two blocks of time per week. Use that time to engage with the materials you have selected.
