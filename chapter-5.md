Throughout the first part of this book, we built up the foundations of ritual practice that you can bring forward into your life. The ritual practices, like most routines, will iterate. You will go through seasons of your life when five minutes *is* all you have and other seasons when you can, and want to, do more. There will be days when showing up at shrine will be the last thing you want to do — maybe you're anxious over an unexpected bill, you've lost a job, or someone in your family is going through a hard time — and other times when you feel the abundant presence of the universe all around you.

Practicing daily rituals and establishing presence with the Gods is slightly different from studying something like religion, theology, or philosophy. Many reading this book may already be thinking of ways to deepen your practice by engaging with learning material, navigating the messy world away from our shrines with integrity, and joining formal or informal group(s). This is the first part of three, and here, we will focus on how to develop your self-directed learning. If you are completely good with your five minutes, the suggestions in this chapter are also adequate for any area of life that you seek to improve.

In your notes on this book, and in your practice thus far, you may have questions. Here are some examples:

* Why is Kaye talking about Platonism? Didn't Plato just write political philosophy? How does this match what I learned in school?
* While praying to Ptah, I came across hymns that used terms unknown to me. What do these mean in Egyptian traditional religion, and how can I build up my knowledge so I understand what I'm reading?
* Stoicism talks about Zeus a lot. Is there a theistic way to approach Stoicism that is different from the Silicon Valley self-help?
* That's a good point about needing to consider honoring Gods associated with yoga if I do yoga. What are ways to approach this that are respectful of South Asian culture?

Before I got really into a Platonizing practice, I had heard from someone that everything I needed to know about the Hellenic Gods is contained within Plato. The first dialogue I read after hearing that, Plato's *Symposium*, was astonishingly different from what was assigned in school — and I wanted to read more. Still, without a committed study habit and with a lot changing in my twenties as I finished school and started working, it was hard to read *anything*, let alone Plato — and the hours I spent on social media didn't help. It wasn't until my late twenties when I left Facebook that I started to rediscover my focus and mental energy.

Generally speaking, there are two types of content you will engage with when you are trying to learn more: academic content and practitioner content. Some academics also worship many Gods (and sometimes the Gods they study), but due to pressures in academia, it can be hard to figure out who they are unless you start talking to people. 

Academic content is most frequently released in the form of journal articles, books (jargon term: scholarly monographs), or gray literature (think PowerPoint slides and conference talk notes). Practitioner content may be in the form of social media posts, blogs and short manuals, and published books. Both academics and practitioners will post lectures to YouTube and other platforms.

One challenge with *any* content in the present century is the politically-charged, polarized atmosphere. For example, content on Nordic Gods is divided between extreme right-wing groups with white supremacist associations and extremely progressive material. The right-wing materials put money into the pockets of people who are harming nonwhite American citizens. The extremely progressive material may assume that you are only one awakening away from becoming a Marxist-anarchist, but it's a more ethically sound financial investment. I usually Google an author's name to see what comes up and avoid people and publishing houses that ring alarm bells, and I do the same with Etsy purchases.

Another challenge is the tendency for people to be pressured to monetize content in order to get by and make rent, especially with today's wealth inequalities — often before that person has enough mastery of the material to be ready to provide a spiritual service to others. In library science, we call this "authority is constructed and contextual" (an information literacy frame as put out by American College and Research Libraries, also known as ACRL). Someone may have a PhD in a topic related to the Gods or initiatory training in a specific tradition, and another person may have spent 20-30 years experimentally working through a practice without much in the way of training or initiation (although, truth be told, nothing happens in a vacuum). Conversely, the Internet is filled with people who got into something 10 months ago and are trying to make money off of it. 

If you are engaging with informal content (like a blog), be sure to check someone's About page and their blog's first few posts. Usually, bloggers will write an origin story at some point to talk about where they started from, and even if that origin story is a decade old on their Wordpress (meaning you don't know where that person is at now without reading their bio for their more recent activities), it gives you valuable information about them. I've changed how I present myself significantly over the past few years due to an increased awareness of and desire to respect modern Hellenes/Greeks. While I have zero expertise in how a Greek person mediates their Hellenic identity, whichever God or Gods they worship, or what worshipping Gods means to them as an individual, I am building up what a theistic cultural reception of the Hellenic Gods can look like in America when it's done tactfully, so that's where I focus my attention. That's a focus of my bio, but the first post on my blog is something I wrote in my mid-to-late 20s about my values and practice, which looked very different at the time.
