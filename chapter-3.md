- Ritual Purity
	- Physical purity
		- Showering
		- Wet wipes, sponges, and washing the hands
		- Accessibility
	- Mental purity
		- Mindfulness techniques
		- Grounding and centering
		- Social media breaks (and/or turning off notifications)
		- Write out your to-do lists
	- Fundamental point: If you wouldn't invite guests over while in this state, it's probably a time to either do purification or take time for yourself.
	- When you need to deal with the impact of embodiment, please be there for yourself
		- Mourning: wait until the new moon to pray again, and cover the shrine. You can still pray away from it and pray to ancestors. If a close relative dies, especially in the waning part of the lunar cycle, I recommend waiting a full lunar cycle and beginning again in the new moon. The night before the moon's first sliver, put a photo of your new ancestor on the ancestor shrine and do something nice for lim.
		- Birth/adoption/fostering: Introduce the newbie to the shrine after bathing
		- Menstruation: Be respectful if you are in a space where there are menstruant taboos (e.g., Kemetism, Hinduism), but otherwise, change your products and do not approach the shrine if you are experiencing debilitating pain.
		- Sex: Clean yourself up before you pray.
		- Sickness: If you are having an acute sickness, do not pray if you cannot otherwise get up to do ordinary household things without feeling ridiculously unwell. If you have a chronic illness and are having a flare-up, do not pray. I also recommend establishing a low-energy prayer routine, medium-energy prayer routine, and high-energy prayer routine so your practice can fit the rhythm of the condition you are managing.
	- If you join an initiatory tradition, some of these things may not apply because the initiatory tradition will have specific protocols for you
	- Exercise: Do a brief meditation or grounding and centering exercise, then pray to a household God, ancestors, or one of the Gods you have picked after the previous chapter. See how taking pause impacted you.

> The biggest thing to remember is that any ancestor or Chthonic god veneration should be kept separate from the place where you honor the heavenly and world-surface gods. Ideally, you would even use separate libation vessels and receptacles. In household worship, many make offerings to Ouranic deities according to specific lunar calendar cycles, and this can be done at the household shrine. The spaces for Chthonic gods and ancestors could legit be on a shelf just below the one you keep for the household gods.


I pray after showering. For me, those habits are linked. Whenever I shower later in the day — for instance, if I've returned from the gym — I immediately think of the prayer beads at one of my shrines.

When I was just starting out with prayer, this is how my mornings would go:

1. Wake up, feed cat, shower
2. Set the kettle on
3. Pray to the hearth Goddess and a God of the day
4. When the kettle went off, I'd end the prayer and get ready for work

It was a simple routine — the kind of thing a young professional juggling many obligations and getting adjusted to adulthood could manage.

But why did I do it after showering?

Honestly, it was to streamline the purification protocols.

*Ritual purity* can sound like a dour topic. The Gods are present everywhere and to everything, so why do we need to wash up? The answer has several components.

First, when we acknowledge the presence of the Gods, especially ones we hold dear, we are welcoming fond associates into our awareness. Like inviting someone over, someone might shower, put on clean clothes, and do some basic tidying. Another person could freshen up by washing hands, putting on fresh deodorant, and tidying one's hair. Writing after the pandemic, when so many more people are experiencing fatigue and related issues as long-COVID side effects, it's important to stress that you do what you can do. However, you *should* shower before a formal shrine prayer if you have just had sex, if you've returned from a funeral or memorial observance, or if you are getting over an illness.

Second, as discussed in earlier chapters, when we pray to the Gods, we are engaging with both them and a plethora of symbols and signs that point to them. Symbolically, doing a purification is a "stripping away" of material garments.
