<blockquote>
<p>Virtue might be described as the perfection of the soul and proper balance of its life and as the highest and purest activity of reason and intellect and discursive intelligence. Let the acts of virtue be taken, above all, as being boniform, excellently fine, intellectual, noble, full of moderation, participant in appropriateness, promoting moral advancement, aiming at the best end, and graceful.</p>
<p>Iamblichus, Letter 16: To Sopater, “On Virtue,” trans. Dillon and Polleichtner</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cultivating virtue and adhering to an ethical system are absolutely essential for engaging with other people. If we define virtue as the excellence by which we are perfectly realizing our soul’s capacity, becoming more virtuous is also an offering that we can give to the Gods, an intangible method of connecting our own partial existence to their expansive, limitless oneness.</p>
<p>Many of us do not think about virtue, morality, or ethics constantly, at least until we are wronged by others or we need to make a hard decision between doing what is convenient and doing what is right. In Proclus’ <em>Ten Problems Concerning Providence</em>, he writes (in alignment, incidentally, with Platonic teachings found in texts like the <em>Phaedrus</em> and <em>Phaedo</em>) that virtue, and what we develop inwardly, remains with us through even the most extreme misfortunes. We are often thwarted from achieving external delights, he says, but we can always turn inward to develop our inner core. In <em>On Providence</em>, Proclus expresses admiration for the teachings of Epictetus, especially the one letting go of what we cannot control.</p>
<p>We often think of virtue in terms of self-denial, with an image of a celibate monk or nun or other renunciate in our minds. The tension between embracing embodiment and fleeing from external pleasures has always existed, both in spiritual and secular philosophies and lifestyles. The guest-house metaphor I used for thinking about ancestry many chapters ago can also be used here as a bridge between this self-denying perspective and a perspective that embraces embodiment. Many virtue systems focus on correct behavior and action because we are acting out roles, and like actors in a play, taking too much of the role into ourselves can be destructive, especially if something happens that jars our most extreme negative emotions.</p>
<p>Broadening out from the system I have internalized, ethical guidance to follow may include things like the Delphic Maxims, Solon’s Tenets, guidance within the Hávamál, Kemetic teachings on Ma’at, the Pythagorean Golden Verses, Stoic writings, Aristotle, the yamas and niyamas of yoga, and so on. There are often commentaries on these guidelines written by practitioners and academics. I encourage you to read as many systems as you need and to think about how they relate to your own life — many date back to ancient times, society has changed, and it can be useful to examine what has remained the same and what is different. The Delphic Maxims, as one example, include one that reads “rule your wife.” Contextual to the culture at the time, men often married women much younger than them, most women did not enjoy vast personal freedoms, and the same stereotype existed about women being overindulgent spendthrifts that exists today in many parts of the world. The maxim is actually about ruling the parts of us that are less seasoned and more prone to desire, all bundled in a metaphor that many women have issues with when we read it.</p>
<p>Typically, people will choose a system that is related to Gods they worship, especially since we have been habituated by the prevailing circumstances in America to view ethics as something given by religious tenets. Once someone starts looking for other like-minded people, it is common for them to study a specific text together. In organizations, examining a specific text may even be part of the onboarding process. One can even examine secular ethical and virtue writings, alone or in community, to tease apart the best elements of a virtuous life.</p>

<p>Many people were taught in their childhood that missteps and incorrect behavior were shameful, often in ways that made them feel powerless to change how others had judged them. We will discuss virtue and ethics from a growth mindset — we all start somewhere, and we all have aspects of our lives that we nail and other parts of our lives where we need to put in more work.</p>
<p>A growth mindset is adequately described in this passage from Plotinus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you do not yet see yourself as beautiful, then be like a sculptor who, making a statue that is supposed to be beautiful, removes a part here and polishes a part there so that he makes the latter smooth and the former just right until he has given the statue a beautiful face. In the same way, you should remove superfluities and straighten things that are crooked, work on the things that are dark, making them bright, and not stop ‘working on your statue’ until the divine splendour of virtue shines in you, until you see ’Self-Control enthroned on the holy seat”</p>
<p>Plotinus, Ennead 1.6.9, trans. Gerson et al.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the above passage, we are encouraged to actually work on the parts of ourselves that seem daunting. From a practical standpoint, we can ask ourselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are my unhealthy habits?</li>
<li>What do I lie to myself about?</li>
<li>What have I been avoiding?</li>
<li>Last time I had a conflict with someone, what went wrong? Is there anything I need to learn for the next time I am in a similar situation?</li>
<li>In the past, what has worked for me when changing behavior? What hasn’t worked?</li>
<li>What are my strengths?</li>
<li>How am I going to build self-care and self-compassion into my personal growth process?</li>
</ul>
<p>The above questions may cause some distress, especially if we have been ignoring something for a long time. Look at pictures of cute animals, listen to relaxing music, and take care of yourself. Moral self-image stress can cause a lot of internal friction.</p>
<p>On a personal note, James Clear’s <em>Atomic Habits</em>, Cal Newport’s <em>Digital Minimalism</em>, the Fabulous App (see your device’s app store), and the interpersonal trainings on LinkedIn Learning have all been immensely useful to me over the years. James Clear wrote, “You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.” This has proven true for me, and it’s one of the principles I used when describing how to start a prayer routine.</p>
<p>➡️ If you are experiencing mental health struggles, I encourage you to see a therapist. Talking through elements of our life with someone else can be a very valuable experience, especially for those of us who had rough childhoods and who developed toxic shame early in our lives.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.1.1</span> Platonic Virtue<a href="virtue.html#platonic-virtue" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>On a functional level, one of the reasons we have so many issues — at least in Platonism — is due to the operation of our three-part soul. As Plato’s Socrates describes in the <em>Republic</em>, we have an appetitive soul (the seat of desire), described as many-headed; a spirited soul (the seat of emotional reactions), described as a lion; and the rational soul (the seat of our logical thinking), what makes us human. In embodiment, the soul’s rational faculties are driven this way and that by the two layers of our irrational soul (appetitive and spirited). Many of our issues in life are due to not having a good handle on our impulses. The virtue that restrains the appetitive soul is temperance; the spirited soul, courage; and the rational soul, prudence. When everything is working together properly, the soul can manifest justice and its highest potential. Mishaps and brief falls are inevitable during our embodiment.</p>
<p>Platonism incorporates some elements of Aristotelian and Stoic teachings to classify levels of virtue according to nature, habitude (sometimes called ethical), civic society, purificatory, contemplative, paradigmatic, and hieratic. Most people do not aim for the contemplative, paradigmatic, and hieratic virtues in their lives; to be functional members of society, we need to have everything up to the civic virtues nailed on a routine basis. The purificatory virtues signal a turn from that outer life to our own interior, culminating in the hieratic, which backflows outward from us and towards others through ritual action and care for the community. Tim Addey’s <em>Unfolding Wings</em> discusses this in greater detail (Chapter 4), as does Mindy Mandell’s <em>Discovering the Beauty of Wisdom</em> (Chapter 4). A good overview from an ancient commentator is Proclus’ Essay 7 on the Republic, which is soon to be released in an English translation. Proclus and Olympiodorus also focus on virtue in their commentaries on Alcibiades I; <a href="https://www.academia.edu/44622434/The_Neoplatonic_Scale_of_Virtues_in_Olympiodorus_Body_and_Soul">the translator of Olympidorus’ commentary on <em>Alcibiades I</em> did a video presentation on the Platonic ladder of virtue</a>.</p>
<p>Usually, the things we want to work on are bad habits. Occasionally, we have errors in our civic judgments — our sense of what is politically right and wrong may be off. Reactively, we may seek out the first ideology that seems “correct” and perpetuate our cycle of ignorance. It is better to explore <em>what</em> was wrong about our old beliefs and to critically interrogate every system we approach. Tim Addey wrote, strikingly, that “conflicting temperaments are often harmonized and reconciled by communal forces [at the habitual level], and [they] only reemerge during the breakdown of civil order” (<em>The Unfolding Wings</em>, 67). I often think about that when I look at the major political upheavals we experience today and how chaotically people react to them.</p>
<p>Virtue has a direct connection to our capacity to receive the Gods when we pray. Working on it calms the discord within our heads. It pulls the soul back from the many desires and passions. When we are calm inside, we can make our focus on prayer more or less complete. This is why, in the <em>Laws</em>, Plato writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]he finest and truest of all principles, in my view — which is that for the good person, in the natural order of things, sacrifice to the gods, contact with them by means of prayers and offerings, and religious observance of every kind is at all times finest and best, the most likely to result in a happy life, and far and away the most appropriate thing for [them].</p>
<p>Laws, 716d, with some gender-neutral modifications</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.2</span> Exercise: Self-Compassion Meditation<a href="virtue.html#exercise-self-compassion-meditation" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Self-compassion meditations are everywhere. As someone who does not teach meditation, this exercise has two components:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Locate a self-compassion meditation.</li>
<li>Do the meditation.</li>
<li>If you like the meditation, do it for a few weeks — pick the date, time, and place you will do this. If you don’t like the meditation, try another kind of self-compassion meditation until you find one that works for you.</li>
</ol>
<p>When thinking about where we fall short of an ideal, all too often, we judge ourselves with more harshness than we deserve. Some of us may even shut down and think, “Well, if I’m not perfect, or with the background I have, what is even the point?” Cultivating self-compassion blunts the impact of these feelings and helps us remain grounded in our inner goodness and potential to be better people.</p>
<p>When you locate a compassion meditation, try to figure out what the meditation is asking you to do. Compassion meditations that ask me to think of a nice thing I have done for someone else make me confused and worried. The first time I tried it, I failed to think of anything, so I looked online to see what people meant. It turned out that many people classify behaviors as “nice” that I was taught were basic courtesy. Even at work, my job is focused on helping people find what they need, so giving a stranger my time and attention is part of a normal day. I have more success with the type of compassion meditation in which one imagines feelings of goodwill and loving-kindness towards others. Some meditations ask us to visualize receiving love from someone who cares about us. I usually think of a God during those segments.</p>
<p>If you use Headspace, there is a self-compassion course in the app by Dora Kamau; she also has a website and <a href="https://insighttimer.com/dorakamau">a presence on Insight Timer</a>. The Headspace course uses my favorite type of compassion exercise. Other meditation apps will show you what is available after doing a keyword search. Dr. Kristin Neff, a researcher who does significant work on self-compassion, has <a href="https://self-compassion.org/guided-self-compassion-meditations-mp3-2/">free downloadable meditations on her website</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.3</span> Exercise: Contemplate Ethical Guidance<a href="virtue.html#exercise-contemplate-ethical-guidance" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>During this contemplation exercise, find some time when you will not be disturbed for a few minutes. Find a pen and paper to write down any thoughts that come up.</p>
<p>Begin this exercise with a prayer to the God(s) of your choice. Then, read aloud the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Put more trust in nobility of character than in an oath. Never tell a lie. Pursue worthy aims. Do not be rash to make friends and, when once they are made, do not drop them. Learn to obey before you command. In giving advice seek to help, not to please, your friend. Be led by reason. Shun evil company. Honour the gods, reverence parents.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Taking each sentence on its own, what comes up for you? Where in your life do you display the value expressed in this tenet? Where could you invest more work, and how?</p>
<p>Do this for each of the elements in turn. When done, thank the God(s) and use the document you have created to create actionable plans for self-development. Feel free to move on to investigate other ethical texts and repeat this exercise. Usually, you will want to reflect on a small chunk of the material.</p>
