We devoted much of the last chapter to discussing many Gods, and we ended with some essentials: household worship and taking time for contemplation. In this chapter, we will build on that and pick one or two more Gods to worship — and, for now, no more than that.

It is not necessary to worship every God that is every day (that would be impossible), just as one cannot be friends with every human being in the world or every sentient being in the cosmos. Beyond worshipping the household Gods and divinities, and perhaps ancestor worship, many people only have the bandwidth for a handful more before their attention is too scattered to have a deep and meaningful practice — and *The Soul's Inner Statues* is focused on breaking down the steps to have such a practice. Sometimes, a person may decide to pray to a collective of Gods: the Muses, for example, or the Fates, Matronae, Attendants of Frigg, Gods of Civic Discourse, Storm Gods, and so on. In my personal practice, I usually pray to the Muses as a collective. Others may devote prayers to all of the Gods in general — often using names and terminology relevant to a specific cultural grouping of Gods, such as the twelve Olympians in Plato's *Phaedrus* or a set of major Roman, Nordic, Celtic, Gaulish, or other deities. 

Keeping the number of Gods limited at first helps you settle into a concise prayer routine, and it allows for mindful expansion of your practice if you judge that expansion to be important to you. Billions of people around the world pray for only a few minutes a day. The most important thing, and the hardest, is showing up.

## How do you pick a God?

The factors involved in choosing Gods to worship are many. In this section, we will discuss a few major ones that are often part of someone's decision-making process.

**Culture and region.** For many people, this is what is done: You worship the God whose temple is down the street (or whose ruins are frequently found in your area) or Gods who are widely present in your cultural substrate, whether or not your culture writ large worships them. In the United States, specific regions, cities, and states may use the motifs of specific Gods or Goddesses, and adding a reverential aspect is often very straightforward. 

**Heritage.** Maintaining a connection to where we come from is important to many people, especially in the United States and other colonies. Whether someone's ancestors arrived in a place voluntarily or via human trafficking and abuse, it can be healthy to explore one's origins when selecting who to worship. My only word of caution is to ensure that you approach this mindfully. Especially for those of us with various European ancestries and ethnic backgrounds, a "return to the roots" can be coopted by the far-right. If you're Scandi, just as many (if not more) non-Scandi people will be looking at Nordic Gods because they saw *Thor*, like gore-filled Viking shows, or fell in love with myths in translation, and they probably fit under one of the other categories here. There are also many people in Scandinavian countries and heavily Scandi parts of America who trace their origins to other parts of the world, but who are culturally Scandi! Anyone can worship the Gods. Resist far-right rhetoric. Developing a practice for the Gods, being committed to learning, and approaching the practice with reverence are what matters.

**Activity.** This is exactly what it sounds like. You know what you like, what you do for work and hobbies, and what you want to be. You find Gods who have well-documented aspects in one or more of those areas and decide to worship them. Most people who worship Gods use this as a criterion for selecting someone to worship.

**Astrology.** In astrological systems, specific Gods are associated with specific signs of the Zodiac. These deities may shift slightly based on the system a writer is using. Sometimes, the position of the rising sign or which sign the moon is in matter just as much as one's sun sign. You can explore this with some Google searches on Gods for specific signs. Keep in mind that "astrology" is a very general term, so you will see results for Western, Vedic, and other forms of astrology. Speaking Platonically, the soul accumulates various traits (or garments) as it descends into the world of becoming, and the positions of the stars at birth have been used as signals of which Gods will be particularly prominent for a person that lifetime.

**Divination-based.** Sometimes, especially in the African Diaspora religions, the God(s) someone should worship closely are determined in divination. Divination protocols for such rituals are usually very intricate, and they require study and care for the practitioner to do them well. Outside of those traditions, others may also consult with divination specialists about deities. Note here that "divination" is a broad category that encompasses far more than tarot and oracle cards!

**Experience.** In Proclus' surviving hymns to the Gods, he makes frequent references to holy words of the wise that excite the soul towards the Gods. This sometimes literally happens to people. Sometimes, you're reading something, you have a dream, or a freaky chance occurrence hits, and it sends chills down your spine. It could even send the world topsy-turvy for a few hours or days. Something feels *right* about it. You may know the name of the God, or you may just know vague things about them. It's a gift when this happens. As a word of caution, keep an eye on your mental health — brain conditions can mimic spiritual experiences, so practice self-awareness and be sure to follow up with a doctor if necessary. (Generally speaking, "you are the chosen one" is something that only happens in Hollywood movies and messianic fringe groups.) Intense spiritual experiences don't happen every day. Praying for a dream or an unambiguous sign is something people have done for millennia in pursuit of some milder spiritual experiences.

When I was a teenager, I decided on Apollon and the Muses because I felt that poetry was the only thing I was good at. In the American cultural reception of Apollon, he's often taken to be synonymous with music and poetry. Little did I know that, when I made that choice, things would change and expand out from there — Apollon is a harmonizing God, first revealed in the truth-bearing triad in Platonism before weaving his way through various levels of emanation from the One. I was worried when I started studying library science that I still thought of him as my patron when my work had nothing to do with him, and I struggled to find ways to relate my life to what I knew about him from his epithets, what scholars had written, and the things I saw people post online about worshipping him. For several years, I strayed away and primarily worshipped Hermes, with Athene secondary, because they are very professionally relevant to my daily work. This was naïve of me given what I know now, and as soon as I was ready to know more about Apollon, specific things in my life fell into place that landed me back worshipping him — everything I needed to know was rooted in the Platonists. I worship Hermes much less now, but still in a professional capacity. We're human. How we pray, and who we pray to, evolves over time.
