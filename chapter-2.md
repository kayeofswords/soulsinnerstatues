We devoted much of the last chapter to discussing many Gods, and we ended with some essentials: household worship and taking time for contemplation. In this chapter, we will build on that and pick one or two more Gods to worship — and, for now, no more than that.

It is not necessary to worship every God that is every day (that would be impossible), just as one cannot be friends with every human being in the world or every sentient being in the cosmos. Beyond worshipping the household Gods and divinities, and perhaps ancestor worship, many people only have the bandwidth for a handful more before their attention is too scattered to have a deep and meaningful practice — and *The Soul's Inner Statues* is focused on breaking down the steps to have such a practice. Sometimes, a person may decide to pray to a collective of Gods: the Muses, for example, or the Fates, Matronae, Attendants of Frigg, Gods of Civic Discourse, Storm Gods, and so on. In my personal practice, I usually pray to the Muses as a collective. Others may devote prayers to all of the Gods in general — often using names and terminology relevant to a specific cultural grouping of Gods, such as the twelve Olympians in Plato's *Phaedrus* or a set of major Roman, Nordic, Celtic, Gaulish, or other deities. 

Keeping the number of Gods limited at first helps you settle into a concise prayer routine, and it allows for mindful expansion of your practice if you judge that expansion to be important to you. Billions of people around the world pray for only a few minutes a day. The most important thing, and the hardest, is showing up.

## How Do You Pick a God?

The factors involved in choosing Gods to worship are many. In this section, we will discuss a few major ones that are often part of someone's decision-making process.

**Culture and region.** For many people, this is what is done: You worship the God whose temple is down the street (or whose ruins are frequently found in your area) or Gods who are widely present in your cultural substrate, whether or not your culture writ large worships them. In the United States, specific regions, cities, and states may use the motifs of specific Gods or Goddesses, and adding a reverential aspect is often very straightforward. 

**Following what a group does.** People raised in a specific religious group, or who join a group as an adult that honors specific deities, often just do what everyone else is doing.

**Heritage.** Maintaining a connection to where we come from is important to many people, especially in the United States and other colonies. Whether someone's ancestors arrived in a place voluntarily or via human trafficking and abuse, it can be healthy to explore one's origins when selecting who to worship. My only word of caution is to ensure that you approach this mindfully. Especially for those of us with various European ancestries and ethnic backgrounds, a "return to the roots" can be coopted by the far-right. If you're Scandi, just as many (if not more) non-Scandi people will be looking at Nordic Gods because they saw *Thor*, like gore-filled Viking shows, or fell in love with myths in translation, and they probably fit under one of the other categories here. There are also many people in Scandinavian countries and heavily Scandi parts of America who trace their origins to other parts of the world, but who are culturally Scandi! Anyone can worship the Gods. Resist far-right rhetoric. Developing a practice for the Gods, being committed to learning, and approaching the practice with reverence are what matters.

**Activity.** This is exactly what it sounds like. You know what you like, what you do for work and hobbies, and what you want to be. You find Gods who have well-documented aspects in one or more of those areas and decide to worship them. Most people who worship Gods use this as a criterion for selecting someone to worship.

**Astrology.** In astrological systems, specific Gods are associated with specific signs of the Zodiac. These deities may shift slightly based on the system a writer is using. Sometimes, the position of the rising sign or which sign the moon is in matter just as much as one's sun sign. You can explore this with some Google searches on Gods for specific signs. Keep in mind that "astrology" is a very general term, so you will see results for Western, Vedic, and other forms of astrology. Speaking Platonically, the soul accumulates various traits (or garments) as it descends into the world of becoming, and the positions of the stars at birth have been used as signals of which Gods will be particularly prominent for a person that lifetime.

**Divination-based.** Sometimes, especially in the African Diaspora religions, the God(s) someone should worship closely are determined in divination. Divination protocols for such rituals are usually very intricate, and they require study and care for the practitioner to do them well. Outside of those traditions, others may also consult with divination specialists about deities. Note here that "divination" is a broad category that encompasses far more than tarot and oracle cards!

**Experience.** In Proclus' surviving hymns to the Gods, he makes frequent references to holy words of the wise that excite the soul towards the Gods. This sometimes literally happens to people. Sometimes, you're reading something, you have a dream, or a freaky chance occurrence hits, and it sends chills down your spine. It could even send the world topsy-turvy for a few hours or days. Something feels *right* about it. You may know the name of the God, or you may just know vague things about them. It's a gift when this happens. As a word of caution, keep an eye on your mental health — brain conditions can mimic spiritual experiences, so practice self-awareness and be sure to follow up with a doctor if necessary. (Generally speaking, "you are the chosen one" is something that only happens in Hollywood movies and messianic fringe groups.) Intense spiritual experiences don't happen every day. Praying for a dream or an unambiguous sign is something people have done for millennia in pursuit of some milder spiritual experiences.

### An Example of Choice

When I was a teenager, I decided on Apollon and the Muses because I felt that poetry was the only thing I was good at. In the American cultural reception of Apollon, he's often taken to be synonymous with music and poetry. Little did I know that, when I made that choice, things would change and expand out from there — Apollon is a harmonizing God, first revealed in the truth-bearing triad in Platonism before weaving his way through various levels of emanation from the One. I was worried when I started studying library science that I still thought of him as my patron when my work had nothing to do with him, and I struggled to find ways to relate my life to what I knew about him from his epithets, what scholars had written, and the things I saw people post online about worshipping him. 

For several years, I strayed away and primarily worshipped Hermes, with Athene secondary, because they are very professionally relevant to my daily work. This was naïve of me given what I know now, and as soon as I was ready to know more about Apollon, specific things in my life fell into place that landed me back worshipping him — everything I needed to know was rooted in the Platonists. I worship Hermes much less now, but still in a professional capacity. We're human. How we pray, and who we pray to, evolves over time.

### What About Specific Traditions?

*The Soul's Inner Statues* is a book about worshipping Gods at home, not about any specific religious tradition. Many of my examples draw on the Hellenic Gods because I have worshipped them for so long, and as a follower of Plato, it's important for avoiding cultural appropriation that I engage with the Gods of the texts and the ancient Platonists. Specific religious traditions often have guidelines that are used to help devotees select a deity, if the tradition doesn't just choose the God for them. What happens in those traditions usually falls into one of the categories that I have named above.

### What About Being Chosen?

While I do believe in spiritual experiences, I *don't* believe that chosenness is possible. What I *do* believe is that many (or is it just us Americans?) use vocabulary from pop culture fantasy novels and Christianity because they don't quite know how to put what they have experienced into words. 

When people are saying this genuinely and not deceptively, I believe this means that they experienced the spiritual version of “friendship at first sight” (which is a real thing in research). They saw a depiction of a God or started to learn about them and just *knew* they needed to worship that God. It can be a very magnetic pull and generate intense, difficult-to-describe emotions. The person making this claim is still the agent. They are the one who decides to offer the libation or light the incense. 

In Platonism, the Gods have something called *providential love* (eros pronoetikos) for us — a type of care flowing without cease and without boundaries to all who are open to receiving it. Experiencing bliss or a sense of deep connection in prayer can sometimes be mistaken for chosenness. Having a religious experience, cleaning oneself up, and committing to excellence can also sometimes lean on the idea of chosenness as a self-soothing mechanism — we like to believe that someone else is rooting for us *specifically*, and it's useful to unpack why we may believe that is the case. In addition, maybe we actually just chose a life where we will do a specific set of activities, and a spiritual experience was the jolt that motivated us to finally get done what we had already committed to doing.

## Appropriation, appreciation, and cultural reception

This chapter requires a section on appropriation, appreciation, and cultural reception (wow, that's a lot, isn't it?) because, in the 21st century, these are all important issues. When we worship a God, we want to know that we're doing it in a way that is ethical and grounded in a sensible response. We do not want to worship with a spirit of cultural voyeurism or appropriation.

The term "cultural appropriation" may already have your stomach tightening, but don't worry: I am not going to tell you that you cannot worship a deity or set of deities. What I *am* going to say is that we all need to be aware of what, for lack of a better way of putting it, has been an extremely f—ed up past several hundred years. Appropriation is a way of discussing that power differential and the ways in which dehumanization and prejudice impact relations among people to this very day, especially where these relationships intersect with cultural objects and practices. Appropriation doesn't always mean that you have to give something up, either — sometimes, it means adding to what you do so you can ensure it is more sensitive and true to itent.

I have done cultural appropriation in the past. In my 20s, when worshipping Hellenic Gods, I participated in communities that saw themselves as cultural continuations of Ancient Greek religious practices. It's embarrassing to think of now, especially now that I realize how antagonistic many of those groups were to actual modern Greek organizations doing the same thing. The truth is that I am American, and while the Greek Gods and motifs inspired by them have been part of American literature, art, and other cultural objects for centuries, it's not the same. Nor does it have to be. We can look to what inspired creatives in the English-speaking world about specific Gods, myths, and stories, and we can do that without fetishizing a past that isn't ours to take. (The same goes, I imagine, for Americans interested in Vikings or ancient Germanic tribes.) This positive outlook can even sit alongside things I know to be awful: the pilfering of Greek cultural artifacts after the Greek liberation from the Ottoman Empire, the way in which Greek heritage was taken to prop up white supremacy while denigrating modern Greeks as too "ethnic" because they failed to fit that narrative, and the callous humanitarian tragedy when Western European powers failed to intervene in the Greek Genocide because we were hungry for trade with the Ottoman Empire's successor state. I can worship the Gods, but I need to ensure that I am speaking from my own context and that I am doing what I can about the bad things.

One way in which Hellenic culture was appropriated was in the appropriation of Platonism to uphold Christianity. Christian Platonism doesn't work (technical reasons involving how the One neither is nor is one), and it's best to approach Plato and Platonism from within the worship framework of the Hellenic Gods. It's possible to map other religious systems with many Gods onto aspects of Platonic theology if one has enough knowledge of both Platonism and the divine system in question, though — they don't cause the same kind of collapse at the summit. However, even in that case, I would recommend engaging with Hellenic Gods out of respect for the Platonic tradition.

This is where we move into "appreciation": Behaving out of respect for a specific tradition and aligning as much as possible with what must be done in it. Let's use another example here. Currently, South Asian Americans in yoga like Anusha Wijeyakumar are advocating for more cultural sensitivity and awareness — one element of that is actually diving *deeper* into Yoga philosophy and learning about its Gods, like Shiva. If you do yoga, learning more about appropriate Gods (and ways to honor them) from South Asian teachers is a great way to move from appropriation to appreciation. You can even start learning about the philosophy! I promise, as a follower of Plato, I won't judge you for it! (But I do disagree with a few things I've read in the Yoga Sūtra commentaries *because* I follow Plato. I disagree with Stoics more.) 

At its most basic, be respectful of Gods and spiritual practices. Those of us who are learning about something as outsiders need to understand and embrace our outsider status for what it is.

Now, let's look at cultural reception.

Cultural reception, the way I am defining it, refers to how something that originated from elsewhere is received and interpreted by a culture, and especially to how the culture processes its relationship to that thing. For example, the cultural reception of Greek and Roman literature in the English-speaking world has historically been tied to elite education, and especially to Anglo-Saxon American landholders. There is a further cultural reception at play nowadays in America where people who have historically had *less* access to the Classics are working with the material (as it was a privileged cultural corpus) and putting it in dialogue with other aspects of American culture. Something similar is happening with Latin American countries' interest in their own histories of Classical reception, although I don't know the details beyond a press release for an initiative that came across my social media feed a year ago.

Those of us who worship Gods of a culture we're not from likely came across those deities through cultural reception.
