We devoted much of the last chapter to discussing many Gods, and we ended with some essentials: household worship and taking time for contemplation. In this chapter, we will build on that and pick one or two more Gods to worship — and, for now, no more than that.

It is not necessary to worship every God that is every day (that would be impossible), just as one cannot be friends with every human being in the world or every sentient being in the cosmos. Beyond worshipping the household Gods and divinities, and perhaps ancestor worship, many people only have the bandwidth for a handful more before their attention is too scattered to have a deep and meaningful practice — and *The Soul's Inner Statues* is focused on breaking down the steps to have such a practice. Sometimes, a person may decide to pray to a collective of Gods: the Muses, for example, or the Fates, Matronae, Attendants of Frigg, Gods of Civic Discourse, Storm Gods, and so on. In my personal practice, I usually pray to the Muses as a collective. Others may devote prayers to all of the Gods in general — often using names and terminology relevant to a specific cultural grouping of Gods, such as the twelve Olympians in Plato's *Phaedrus* or a set of major Roman, Nordic, Celtic, Gaulish, or other deities. 

Keeping the number of Gods limited at first helps you settle into a concise prayer routine, and it allows for mindful expansion of your practice if you judge that expansion to be important to you. Billions of people around the world pray for only a few minutes a day. The most important thing, and the hardest, is showing up.

As you read this chapter, take some notes on what comes up for you. The exercise at the end will ask you to look up one or two Gods and to pray to them.

## How Do You Pick a God?

The factors involved in choosing Gods to worship are many. In this section, we will discuss a few major ones that are often part of someone's decision-making process.

**Culture and region.** For many people, this is what is done: You worship the God whose temple is down the street (or whose ruins are frequently found in your area) or Gods who are widely present in your cultural substrate, whether or not your culture writ large worships them. In the United States, specific regions, cities, and states may use the motifs of specific Gods or Goddesses, and adding a reverential aspect is often very straightforward. 

**Following what a group does.** People raised in a specific religious group, or who join a group as an adult that honors specific deities, often just do what everyone else is doing.

**Heritage.** Maintaining a connection to where we come from is important to many people, especially in the United States and other colonies. Whether someone's ancestors arrived in a place voluntarily or via human trafficking and abuse, it can be healthy to explore one's origins when selecting who to worship. My only word of caution is to ensure that you approach this mindfully. Especially for those of us with various European ancestries and ethnic backgrounds, a "return to the roots" can be coopted by the far-right. If you're Scandi, just as many (if not more) non-Scandi people will be looking at Nordic Gods because they saw *Thor*, like gore-filled Viking shows, or fell in love with myths in translation, and they probably fit under one of the other categories here. There are also many people in Scandinavian countries and heavily Scandi parts of America who trace their origins to other parts of the world, but who are culturally Scandi! Anyone can worship the Gods. Resist far-right rhetoric. Developing a practice for the Gods, being committed to learning, and approaching the practice with reverence are what matters.

**Activity.** This is exactly what it sounds like. You know what you like, what you do for work and hobbies, and what you want to be. You find Gods who have well-documented aspects in one or more of those areas and decide to worship them. Most people who worship Gods use this as a criterion for selecting someone to worship.

**Astrology.** In astrological systems, specific Gods are associated with specific signs of the Zodiac. These deities may shift slightly based on the system a writer is using. Sometimes, the position of the rising sign or which sign the moon is in matter just as much as one's sun sign. You can explore this with some Google searches on Gods for specific signs. Keep in mind that "astrology" is a very general term, so you will see results for Western, Vedic, and other forms of astrology. Speaking Platonically, the soul accumulates various traits (or garments) as it descends into the world of becoming, and the positions of the stars at birth have been used as signals of which Gods will be particularly prominent for a person that lifetime.

**Divination-based.** Sometimes, especially in the African Diaspora religions, the God(s) someone should worship closely are determined in divination. Divination protocols for such rituals are usually very intricate, and they require study and care for the practitioner to do them well. Outside of those traditions, others may also consult with divination specialists about deities. Note here that "divination" is a broad category that encompasses far more than tarot and oracle cards!

**Experience.** In Proclus' surviving hymns to the Gods, he makes frequent references to holy words of the wise that excite the soul towards the Gods. This sometimes literally happens to people. Sometimes, you're reading something, you have a dream, or a freaky chance occurrence hits, and it sends chills down your spine. It could even send the world topsy-turvy for a few hours or days. Something feels *right* about it. You may know the name of the God, or you may just know vague things about them. It's a gift when this happens. As a word of caution, keep an eye on your mental health — brain conditions can mimic spiritual experiences, so practice self-awareness and be sure to follow up with a doctor if necessary. (Generally speaking, "you are the chosen one" is something that only happens in Hollywood movies and messianic fringe groups.) Intense spiritual experiences don't happen every day. Praying for a dream or an unambiguous sign is something people have done for millennia in pursuit of some milder spiritual experiences.

### An Example of Choice

When I was a teenager, I decided on Apollon and the Muses because I felt that poetry was the only thing I was good at. In the American cultural reception of Apollon, he's often taken to be synonymous with music and poetry. Little did I know that, when I made that choice, things would change and expand out from there — Apollon is a harmonizing God, first revealed in the truth-bearing triad in Platonism before weaving his way through various levels of emanation from the One. I was worried when I started studying library science that I still thought of him as my patron when my work had nothing to do with him, and I struggled to find ways to relate my life to what I knew about him from his epithets, what scholars had written, and the things I saw people post online about worshipping him. 

For several years, I strayed away and primarily worshipped Hermes, with Athene secondary, because they are very professionally relevant to my daily work. This was naïve of me given what I know now, and as soon as I was ready to know more about Apollon, specific things in my life fell into place that landed me back worshipping him — everything I needed to know was rooted in the Platonists. I worship Hermes much less now, but still in a professional capacity. We're human. How we pray, and who we pray to, evolves over time.

### What About Specific Traditions?

*The Soul's Inner Statues* is a book about worshipping Gods at home, not about any specific religious tradition. Many of my examples draw on the Hellenic Gods because I have worshipped them for so long, and as a follower of Plato, it's important for avoiding cultural appropriation that I engage with the Gods of the texts and the ancient Platonists. Specific religious traditions often have guidelines that are used to help devotees select a deity, if the tradition doesn't just choose the God for them. What happens in those traditions usually falls into one of the categories that I have named above.

### What About Being Chosen?

While I do believe in spiritual experiences, I *don't* believe that chosenness is possible. What I *do* believe is that many (or is it just us Americans?) use vocabulary from pop culture fantasy novels and Christianity because they don't quite know how to put what they have experienced into words. 

When people are saying this genuinely and not deceptively, I believe this means that they experienced the spiritual version of “friendship at first sight” (which is a real thing in research). They saw a depiction of a God or started to learn about them and just *knew* they needed to worship that God. It can be a very magnetic pull and generate intense, difficult-to-describe emotions. The person making this claim is still the agent. They are the one who decides to offer the libation or light the incense. 

In Platonism, the Gods have something called *providential love* (eros pronoetikos) for us — a type of care flowing without cease and without boundaries to all who are open to receiving it. Experiencing bliss or a sense of deep connection in prayer can sometimes be mistaken for chosenness. Having a religious experience, cleaning oneself up, and committing to excellence can also sometimes lean on the idea of chosenness as a self-soothing mechanism — we like to believe that someone else is rooting for us *specifically*, and it's useful to unpack why we may believe that is the case. In addition, maybe we actually just chose a life where we will do a specific set of activities, and a spiritual experience was the jolt that motivated us to finally get done what we had already committed to doing.

### An Important Caveat About Gods’ Functional Roles

Many of us are initially drawn to a deity because they have a specific functional role. It establishes rapport between you and the God before you have first prayed to them, much like how reading a social media profile and learning that you have something in common with someone will usually prime you to treat them charitably.

Often, someone may ask, “so, if I have *x* issue, which deity should I go to?” after they already have a foundational Gods-oriented outlook and ritual shrine. We are conditioned by the media and oversimplify what divine epithets and spheres of influence of a deity mean. (An epithet is like “Apollon the Far-Shooter” or “Apollon the Harmonizer of All” or “Apollon of Delphi” — it marks some specific aspect of a God, and people will often use epithets to praise a deity when starting out a prayer.) Aphrodite is only a Goddess of Love, for example, or Eir is only a Goddess of Healing.

Once we get to know a deity, however, these functional areas start to break down. Apollon is most associated with poetry, music, light, and harmony, and yet I might pray to him for assistance with a family issue. I have worshipped Apollon for decades and can easily access that space within myself, and within the ritual space, that is resonant with the God in a way that facilitates steadiness even when moving into uncharted zones. 

In the Platonic tradition, every God is the totality of everything (“all in all”) while preserving their own unique individuality and oneness. Gods worshipped in a specific part of the world “flow” into conversation with cultures and ethnic groups to produce unique fingerprints of how Gods operate in specific places. A group may be united by a similar outlook when they live very far apart as long as they are united by common narratives and philosophical outlooks. These relationships evolve all of the time, progressing forward in time. We are now living in an era when much of the world is alienated from Gods.

Syrianus, in critiquing Aristotle's *Metaphysics*, Books 13-14, wrote that

>[T]he whole placing of the stars involves much supposition on our part. Thus it is that the fixed stars are arranged in one way according to the Egyptians, but according to the Chaldaeans or the Greeks in another way.  /
– Syrianus, On Aristotle's Metaphysics 13-14, trans. John Dillon and Dominic J. O'Meara, 2014, 191,23-25

While Gods do not have positions in the sky, when we create traditions surrounding the Gods, and especially when those traditions become cultural forces, humans are pattern-finders. We arrange the Gods in different ways based on our contexts. We may divide up the sky differently, omit some types of stories and deities in favor of others, but the same *potentiality* of divine multitude underlies all of this.

Sometimes, the functional role a deity has traditionally occupied is very important to us long after we've solidified who we worship the most. I have a soft spot for solar and light-related deities.

## A Chain, Unbroken

In Platonism, there is one other type of divine relationship — something that is not a choice and could never be a choice. In Platonic doctrine, every soul is in the *series* of a specific God. A *series* is a chain that goes from the God through the hierarchies of intermediary spirits, ultimately ending with each of us. Because this is an innate property of every soul, it is not special; because we are each individuals who express that individuality differently, every soul in a series has its unique, particular way in which it is linked to the God that seeds it. This doctrine calls those of us who hold it to probe the paradox of something as ordinary as grass being so individually important.

The following long quotation comes from Proclus during a discussion of people incarnating into lives that are like and unlike the divine series one is suspended from. 

> Even amid matters that seem difficult to understand or puzzling, the person who simply *knows* takes the easy path to divine understanding (*gnôsis*) — retracing [a path that runs via] the divinely inspired cognition (*entheos noêsis*) through which things become clear and familiar (*gnôrimos*), for all things are in the gods. The one who has antecedently comprehended all things is able to fill others with his own understanding. This is precisely what Timaeus has done here when he refers us to the authority of the Theologians and the generation of the gods celebrated by them.  / Who, then, are these people and what is the understanding (*gnôsis*) that belongs to them? Well, in the first place, they are 'offspring of the gods' and 'clearly know their own parents.' They are offspring and children of the gods in as much as they conserve the form of the god who presides over them through their current way of life, for Apollonian souls are called 'offspring and children of Apollo' when they choose a life that is prophetic or dedicated to mystic rites (*telestikos bios*). These souls are called 'children' of Apollo to the extent that they belong to this god in particular and are adapted to that series down here. By contrast, they are called offspring of Apollo because their present lifestyle displays them as such. All souls are therefore children of god, but not all of them have *recognised* the gods whose children they are. Those who recognise [their leading gods] and choose a similar life are called 'children of gods.' This is why Plato added the words 'as they say,' for these souls [sc. those of the people to whose authority Timaeus proposes to defer] reveal the order from which they come — as in the case of the Sibyl who delivered oracles from the moment of her birth or Heracles who appeared at his birth together with Demiurgic symbols. When souls of this sort revert upon their parents, they are filled by them with divinely inspired cognition *(entheos noêsis*). Their understanding (*gnôsis*) is a matter of divine possession since they are connected to the god through the divine light and [this sort of understanding] transcends all other [kinds of] understanding — both that achieved through [reasoning through] what is likely (*di’ eikotôn*), as well as that which is demonstrative (*apodeiktikos*). The former deals with nature and the universals that are in the particulars, while the latter deals with incorporeal essence (*ousia*) and things that are objects of knowledge. But divinely inspired understanding alone is connected to the gods themselves.  / Proclus, Commentary on Plato's Timaeus Book 4 (confusingly, Volume 5), trans. Baltzly, 159.14-160.12 — all of the things in parentheses and brackets are from Baltzly

As incarnating souls, we "dip down" into various types of lives, from rational lives (think humans, orcas, cetaceans) to nonrational lives (think incarnating as a cat). Above us are heroes, who have a dipping point of rational lives (so, they can't become cats), above them daimones and angels (who do not have dipping points into material bodies), and finally, the Gods themselves. Every God has a chain of these intermediaries. At the risk of sounding too spatial for something that is not demarcated by space, the God is the "trunk", the angels are the "boughs", and the various levels of daimones are the branches that we (leaves) are suspended from. Each daimon has a cluster of souls it supervises. In addition, specific lives have presiding daimones.

When it comes to embodiment, we have a big challenge: our forgetfulness and our ability to get extremely preoccupied with what happens in specific incarnations or series of incarnations. We sometimes pick life-patterns that align with our leader-God, and sometimes we don't. This is one of the reasons I called each of us unique — we make traces in the world like fingerprints. Some of our journeys express the tragic beauty of our leader-Gods, or the violent and horrific ones, or the depths of disappointment; others skim the surface of generation, like a bird of prey diving into the sea to come back with good nourishment. The story of Cassandra, for instance, is metaphorically about being given gifts and then turning away from a God who cannot be run from because he is already the core of her; there are just as many people given the same prophetic gifts and who are not believed, yet never turn from the source of their good. In this context, part of the maxim γνῶθι σεαυτόν (know thyself) is to uncover this knowledge of who we truly are when we cast away all of those garments and to perform our role in the most just way possible. The role may not be an easy one regardless of how we make that approach.

The term *series* can also be used in a way related to the astrological side note about Platonism that I made when discussing how we know who should receive our prayers. The term has a technical meaning and a slippery one, and in its slippery sense, it refers to the God or Gods who preside over our current lifetimes, who may or may not be the same as the God we are suspended from, and Gods who are highly related to specific talents and skills that we have in this lifetime. In other words, it can be tough to figure out who our leader-God is if we approach it just based on what we're good at or the specific aspects of the daily grind.

> But we should ask which of the aforementioned six types of essential daimons they say is allotted to each person. Well then, they say that those who live according to their own essence (kat’ousian) – that is, as they were born to live (pephukasi) – have the divine daimon allotted to them, and for this reason we can see that these people are held in high esteem in whatever walk of life they pursue (epitêdeuein). Now [to live] ‘according to essence’ is to choose the life that befits the chain from which one is suspended: for example, [to live] the military life, if [one is suspended] from the [chain] of Ares; or the life of words and ideas (logikos), if from that of Hermes; or the healing or prophetic life, if from that of Apollo; or quite simply, as was said earlier, to live just as one was born to live.  / But if someone sets before himself a life that is not according to his essence, but some other life that differs from this, and focuses in his undertakings on someone else’s work – they say that the intellective (noêros) [daimon] is allotted to this person, and for this reason, because he is doing someone else’s work, he fails to hit the mark in some [instances]. -  / Olympiodorus, writing on our allotted daimon, at (20?) of the *Alcibiades* commentary

This confusion is not even a bad thing. We are like libations that our leader-God is pouring out for other Gods, honoring them. Water is a symbol of generation. A God pouring a libation for another God, or doing sacrifice in general for another God, is a gift of participation in a portion of their divinity to another, mediated by this weird realm of generation where so many things are possible. In the *Timaeus*, our “bodies” are formed by the action of many younger Gods. We are each, at our core, a one, and the flower at the core of us is always connected to the God we are suspended from; we are, at our periphery, dazzled by and participating in the amalgam of divine delights, a reflection in water of the feast that the Gods share in the *Phaedrus*. (The friction that I mentioned earlier between the God I am always drawn to and the aspects of my life that are not in alignment often has me wondering if this friction is due to what Olympiodorus says about lives unlike our leader-God and how we can sometimes fail to hit the mark in them. It's good food for thought, especially for bringing up in a contemplative exercise.)

In generation, the beautiful divine patterns — each driven by a specific God — "freeze" out. Like a frustrated spin glass, there is no configuration of the whole system that can be metastable permanently. (Proclus describes this frustration in an essay on evils, albeit in a different way.) These conditions, and these phases of imperfect stability, evolve with time. We are locked in one position only to shift to another. We have that stability of who we are, but also that instability inherent in this environment. Some types of closeness with a God or Gods are driven by where we are in our life or lives; others are metastable over long periods; and only one relationship is absolutely intrinsic.

For those of us who hold that we belong to a God, we can add so much insecurity to this innate wonder of existence. We can also fall prey to our egos, propping up specific fragmentary experiences above the experience’s actual worth. How many people have had a vision of a deity and propped themselves up as a New Age cult leader? How many have had a delusion, or the triggering of a psychological episode in need of treatment, that never gets treated because it is mistaken for something divine? How many have laminated and displayed a transformative spiritual experience in a way that has made them miserable due to their reliance on it as an object of reverence instead of taking it for the transient beauty it truly was? How many have mistaken a divine gift of insight into their own nature, a sacred unveiling of their soul through the power of the God’s providential love, for being chosen by either the God at their core or the God ruling their present life or a God of affinity? How many have used personal experiences like this to engage in appropriation, spiritual materialism, and spiritual bypassing that take the wonder of what happened and turn it into something awful? They could have instead focused on the God! When we focus on the basics of prayer, ritual, and piety, we embrace the changing rhythms of our lives, which is in our nature as souls who are living a life in the material world. We allow ourselves to explore what our relationships to specific Gods mean without grasping tightly to something that will eventually fall away like sand through our fingertips.

In the last chapter, when I quoted from Plotinus before presenting the meditation exercise to you, there is a moment when Plotinus instructs us to ask for the God to come. This is the kind of contemplative practice that can guide you to who that leader-God is, if this practical Platonic section piques your interest.

If this does interest you, I end this section with these words. Feel free to contemplate them in meditation or to try that Plotinian-cosmic meditation again. Close your eyes, find that stillness, and the God who is intrinsic to you is there. It is not something available to the privileged few, but directly accessible to all. Every human soul, and I do mean each and every one of us, is a prayer *continuously* without you even realizing it, just as a heliotrope follows the sun.

## Appropriation, appreciation, and cultural reception

This chapter requires a section on appropriation, appreciation, and cultural reception (wow, that's a lot, isn't it?) because, in the 21st century, these are all important issues. When we worship a God, we want to know that we're doing it in a way that is ethical and grounded in a sensible response to our desire to worship them. We do not want to worship with a spirit of cultural voyeurism or appropriation.

The term "cultural appropriation" may already have your stomach tightening, but don't worry: I am not going to tell you that you cannot worship a deity or set of deities. What I *am* going to say is that we all need to be aware of what, for lack of a better way of putting it, has been an extremely f—ed up past several hundred years. Appropriation is a way of discussing that power differential and the ways in which dehumanization and prejudice impact relations among people to this very day, especially where these relationships intersect with cultural objects and practices. Addressing appropriation doesn't always mean that you have to give something up, either — sometimes, it means adding to what you do so you can ensure it is more sensitive and true to itent.

I have done cultural appropriation in the past. In my 20s, when worshipping Hellenic Gods, I participated in communities that saw themselves as cultural continuations of Ancient Greek religious practices. It's embarrassing to think of now, especially now that I realize how antagonistic many of those groups were to actual modern Greek organizations doing the same thing. The truth is that I am an American without Greek ancestry, and while the Greek Gods and motifs inspired by them have been part of American literature, art, and other cultural objects for centuries, it's not the same. Nor does it have to be. We can look to what inspired creatives in the English-speaking world about specific Gods, myths, and stories, and we can do that without fetishizing a past that isn't ours to take. (The same goes, I imagine, for Americans interested in Vikings or ancient Germanic tribes.) This positive outlook can even sit alongside things I know to be awful: the pilfering of Greek cultural artifacts after the Greek liberation from the Ottoman Empire, the way in which Greek heritage was taken to prop up white supremacy while denigrating modern Greeks as too "ethnic" because they failed to fit that narrative, and the callous humanitarian tragedy when Western European powers failed to intervene in the Greek Genocide because we were hungry for trade with the Ottoman Empire's successor state. I can worship the Gods, but I need to ensure that I am speaking from my own context and that I am doing what I can about the bad things — activities like supporting repatriation efforts and ensuring that I am mindful of modern Hellenic continuity with their past.

One way in which Hellenic culture was appropriated was in the appropriation of Platonism to uphold Christianity. Christian Platonism doesn't work (for technical reasons involving how the One neither is nor is one), and it's best to approach Plato and Platonism from within the worship framework of the Hellenic Gods. It's possible to map other religious systems with many Gods onto aspects of Platonic theology if one has enough knowledge of both Platonism and the divine system in question, though — they don't cause the same kind of collapse at the summit. However, even in that case, I would recommend engaging with Hellenic Gods out of respect for the Platonic tradition if one is studying and/or practicing Platonism.

This is where we move into "appreciation": Behaving respectfully and aligning as much as possible with what must be done in it. Let's use another example here. Currently, South Asian Americans in yoga like Anusha Wijeyakumar are advocating for more cultural sensitivity and awareness — one element of that is actually diving *deeper* into Yoga philosophy and learning about its Gods, like Shiva. If you do yoga, learning more about important Gods (and ways to honor them) from South Asian teachers is a great way to move from appropriation to appreciation. You can even start learning about the philosophy! I promise, as a follower of Plato, I won't judge you for it!

At its most basic, be respectful of Gods and spiritual practices. Those of us who are learning about something as outsiders need to understand and embrace our outsider status for what it is. Two things I've found helpful to read are [this article from *the Atlantic*](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/10/the-dos-and-donts-of-cultural-appropriation/411292/) and [this piece on cultural appropriation when worshipping many Gods and how that is related to the treatment of everything as if it were a commodity item](https://abeautifulresistance.org/site/2021/6/03/plague-of-gods).

Cultural reception, the way I am defining it, refers to how something that originated from elsewhere is received and interpreted by a culture, and especially to how the receiving culture processes its relationship to that thing. For example, the cultural reception of ancient Mediterranean literature and philosophy in the English-speaking world has historically been tied to elite education, especially to white landholders and old money families. There is a further cultural reception at play nowadays in America where people who have historically had *less* access to the Classics are working with the material (as it was a privileged cultural corpus) and putting it in dialogue with other aspects of American culture. All of us in America, colonizers and colonized, are swimming in that unique amalgam. Something similar is happening with Latin American countries' interest in their own histories of Classical reception, although I don't know the details beyond a press release for an initiative that came across my social media feed a year ago.

Those of us who worship Gods of a culture we're not from likely came across those deities through cultural reception. Importantly, cultural reception may have very little to do with the culture something originated in. However, due to globalization, there are many opportunities for clashes to occur.

Syncretism is what happens when you combine belief systems — and sometimes Gods — in a systematic way. To use a linguistics analogy, syncretism is a lot like what happens when speakers of multiple languages convene in a single location — at first, there are communication issues, but a way to communicate quickly starts. Eventually, a creole language is produced, with its own vocabulary, grammar, and syntax drawn from all of the components that fed into it. It's very different from speaking multiple languages (the analogy for practicing multiple ways of worship at the same time, but keeping them separate). At some point, the new language is formalized and becomes an institution of its own.

Syncretism is often contrasted with eclecticism, an anything-goes approach that cares a bit less about how things fit together to form a whole. Many eclectics value the relationships with each specific God and are not worried about connecting the dots between the Gods like syncretics are.

Syncretic and eclectic practices are what most of us in America will end up doing — and, if not us, our children. We come from many places, with a vast array of cultural inputs. Almost everything is Americanized eventually, albeit to different degrees, and what matters most is that we stay curious about the Gods and our practice. The world is full of Gods, as Thales said.

An example of a syncretic (and slightly eclectic — it's a gradient) practice would be if someone were to map hearth Goddesses from their heritage onto physical directions and pray to them according to direction. Returning to what I said about worshipping four hearth Goddesses, I might set Frigg as East/Air, Hestia as South/Fire, Brigando as West/Water, and Nantosuelta as North/Earth. This would be a nesting doll of syncretism. First, I am looking at Goddesses from four different contexts; second, I am combining them with directional quarters that are used in modern popular Wicca; and third, I am praying to all of the Goddesses at the same time using that directional context. The unifying elements here would be that these Goddesses represent both hearth Goddesses of my maternal and paternal families, plus the Hellenic Gods that I pray to out of fondness. It would efficiently get around questions of who to pray to (and when) by praying to them all at once.

Another example of a syncretic practice would be the fusion of Belesama with Minerva in Roman Gaul. Belesama is a solar Goddess, with strong water associations; she is wisdom-filled, good with words, and radiant. During that historical period, she was seen as the local version of Minerva by Roman authorities, and the worship of the two Goddesses fused together. Belesama and Minerva are distinct Goddesses. I would, based on personal contemplative experience, place Belesama in a similar conceptual space to Apollon, Aletheia, and Helios. Sulis, another Goddess who was syncretized by Romans to Minerva, was also worshipped as Minerva during the Roman occupation. She has more in common with Hygeia and Salus.

## Practice

Choose one (or more) of the methods listed above for selecting deities. Use resources available to you to learn more. It's OK if it's Wikipedia — check the Talk page of whichever deity's page you land on if you see anything you're really unsure about. The Talk page can be accessed at a link just above the page title, and it shows you what editors have been arguing about while maintaining the page. Other options include looking up terms like "Norse pantheon list of Gods."

Narrow down to one or two deities. Do another search, but just for them. You might use "-tumblr -twitter -pinterest" to remove things from the results if you're using Google.

Here are a few questions to guide you: What kinds of offerings are typically given to this deity? What are their main symbols? Were they worshipped in any specific regions? What kinds of appearances does this God make in pop culture today? Are there any surviving ancient prayers that you could give them?

Once you have done your research, write down the God's name on a piece of paper and go to your small shrine space. After praying to the hearth Gods, pray to one of the Gods you have chosen. Say hello in whatever way comes most naturally to you and give an offering. The offering could be the same one that you gave to the hearth Gods or a different one.

If you know extemporaneous speaking isn't for you, you're welcome to prepare something written to read for the God during this first introductory prayer. You might give your name, the reason you are praying to this deity out of all of your other options, and provide some important information. What would you tell another person you've just met?

After praying, take a few moments to pause.

The information you've learned about the God is also useful for contemplative practices.
