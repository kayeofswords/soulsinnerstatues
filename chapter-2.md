We devoted much of the last chapter to discussing many Gods, and we ended with some essentials: household worship and taking time for contemplation. In this chapter, we will build on that and pick one or two Gods to worship — and, for now, no more than that.

It is not necessary to worship every God every day, just as one cannot be friends with every human being in the world. Beyond worshipping the household Gods and divinities and your ancestors, many people only have the bandwidth for a handful more before their attention is scattered. Sometimes, a person may decide to pray to a collective of Gods: the Muses, for example, or the Fates, Matronae, Attendants of Frigg, Gods of Civic Discourse, Storm Gods, and so on. In my personal practice, I usually pray to the Muses as a collective. Others may devote prayers to all of the Gods in general — often using names and terminology relevant to a specific cultural grouping of Gods, such as the twelve Olympians in Plato's *Phaedrus* or a set of major Roman, Nordic, Celtic, Gaulish, or other deities. 

Keeping the number of Gods limited at first helps you settle into a concise prayer routine, and it allows for mindful expansion of your practice if you judge that expansion to be important to you. Billions of people around the world pray for only a few minutes a day. The most important thing, and the hardest, is showing up.
