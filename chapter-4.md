This chapter is about the mechanics of devotional activity — or, building on the successes you have built in previous chapters through establishing and maintaining a core ritual practice to enliven the rhythm of your life. Human lives are not the same from season to season, year to year, and decade to decade. We have life stages. The stars and planets trace out their orbits.

Within our human lifetimes, there are times when we all pray for things we need in our lives: success at work, a new job, the satisfactory resolution of difficult interpersonal interactions, a better apartment, the ability to get to a flight on time.

We also pray according to seasons: when new herbs we are growing from seed first send up their shoots, when the ice and snow come and recede, for a gentle landfall of the hurricanes pummelling our shores during hurricane season. We pray for good harvests, happy new years, and abundant gift-giving seasons.

This chapter discusses how to incorporate these occasions into your practice. We will begin discussing the lunar and solar cycles, then get into specific types of cycles that happen in our lifetime — age milestones, deaths, and the inevitabilities of our lives.

## Following the Sun and Moon

In Proclus' *Timaeus* commentary, the philosopher points at the divine presence within things as seemingly intangible as time durations and motions of the heavens:

>There is, of course, a parallel with the sacred tradition which worships the former invisible [numbers] that are the causes of these [visible ones] by naming Night and Day as gods, as well as by delivering those things that commend one to the month and the year, the invocations and self-manifestations. These things are considered not as things to be totted up on one's fingers, but rather as among the things that have divine subsistence — things which the sacred laws of those who serve as priests command us to worship and honour by means of statues and sacrifices. The oracles of Apollo also confirm this, as the stories say, and when these things were honoured, the benefits that result from the periods belonged to human beings, both the benefits of the seasons and those of other [periods] similarly. However, when these things were neglected a condition contrary to nature was the result for everything around the Earth. Not only that, but Plato himself in the <em>Laws</em> (X 899b2) positively shouts out that all these things are gods: seasons, months and years — just like the stars and the Sun. We are introducing no sort of innovation when we say that it is worthwhile to conceive of the invisible powers that are prior to these visible things [as gods]. So much for these matters.  /

We can use this as our starting point for discussing how to build veneration of the moon and sun into your practice.

### Venerating the Moon

There are four types of moon veneration that you can build into your life: the rhythms of waxing and waning, moonrise, moonset, and eclipses. It is a rare person who venerates the moon in all of these ways — people who have that kind of time are, generally speaking, devoted to spiritual lives to an extent beyond what is attainable for most people. I do not follow moonrise and moonset, for example, nor do I generally follow the eclipses unless they happen when I am awake.

The moon has in many places been seen as a feminine symbol related to fertility and the process of generation. Writers have long pointed out the relationship between its length and the length of menstrual cycles — as one of the few species of animal that has these, we are tied to swift cycles in a way that few other animals are. In other cultures, the moon and its God have been seen as masculine — hence the "man in the moon" motif common in Anglosphere culture, the God Mani of the Nordic tradition, and so on. In Platonism, everything below the moon's orbit is called the "sublunary realm" — while, in 2022, we no longer profess a geocentric worldview, we can take this as a symbol similar to what Carl Sagan says when discussing the "pale blue dot" and what others say about the slim sliver of atmosphere separating us from the void beyond. The moon is our closest companion, responsible for tides and an assistant to animals from afar. While not falling prey to the worst of the realm of generation, and achieving union with the One and ascending into the place beyond generation are goals within Platonism, only a few (I'm thinking of Plotinus) are on the record as shying away from lunar ceremonies. Marinus, in the *Life of Proclus*, communicates how the divine successor of Plato, on arriving at the Platonic school in Athens, prostrated to the moon on seeing it in the sky. This action convinced the school's leaders of his piety when they had previously not known what to make of him.

Within the lunar cycle, the definitions I am about to use are slightly different from what you will see when you look at a wall calendar. In many calendars form the ancient world, including the one I have used for most of my activities, the ritual month begins the day after the lightless moon — that first slim sliver is called the new moon. On your wall calendar, or with whichever moon phase extension you've added to Google Calendar or Outlook, the calendar will refer to the dark/lightless moon as the new moon. The dark moon, new moon, and full moon are the major times at which someone might venerate this cycle.

The dark moon is a perfect time to pray to one's ancestors. If you are living near where your family is buried, visiting the gravesite to offer flowers and clean up the graves would be a lovely gesture. It is a time to pray to apotropaic Goddesses. Many such Goddesses preside over the paradoxes of goods and evils we find in the world around us. Hekate, for example, is both the Goddess who rules the spirits of the material worlds and the salvation from them; Eris, who is most associated with the apple incident that started the Trojan War, is both a Goddess of discord as well as a Goddess who disrupts difficult situations so they can come to a useful resolution. You may also pray to underworld deities at this time. The dark moon, or in fact any time within the final few days of a lunar cycle, is a great time to clean one's home and donate those boxes you've been meaning to take care of.

The new moon is a time of beginnings. Its first sliver is a day to mark as a special occasion for your household Gods and any special Gods of affinity you may have. Dust the shrine, give an offering slightly fancier than usual, and cook something nice for yourself and/or your family. If you make a dessert, offer some to the Gods. Debrief, via freewriting, how your last month has gone and what you could do in the month to come. Talk to the Gods about your plans and pray that you can take the lessons of the past month forward in the best way possible. 

Specific traditions may mark the new lunar month (either on the dark or new moon) with special rituals for specific Gods. If you seek out training and guidance in any of these traditions, expect that your lunar observances may change.

The full moon, depending on the tradition, may or may not be emphasized. Many current and historical holidays for Gods will fall in the days leading up to or just after the full moon — but then again, there are often holidays at other times, too.  

## Praying for What Is Possible

The best time to start praying for something is at the beginning — weeks before you have that exam or performance evaluation when you start to feel the pressure. There is a fable from Aesop called "The Shipwrecked Man and Athene" in which a shipwrecked sailor prays to Athene (his city's patron Goddess) to be saved from the ocean. Another man, swimming by, says, "Pray to the Goddess for success, but move your arms!" — the Gods can open up pathways for us, but we need to commit effort.

Prayers at the last moment may sometimes be answered, but there is nothing strange about this — as souls who inhabit material bodies, and who are under the care of the Gods, it is in our nature to be able to *act in the material world* with these bodies. That is why we descend into generation (CITE the article + passages from others). 

One way to make this part of your life is to say a short prayer to major Gods you already pray to whenever you're about to start planning a project or writing a complex, multi-part to-do list. It doesn't need to be fancy, just a few words — and at the end of the project's completion, thank the Gods you prayed to with an offering that is slightly fancier than usual. It's up to you how to interpret *fancy*.

## Praying for What Is Inevitable

Our sun, now a main sequence star, continues to eat her fuel, leaving just a little bit less to use an instant from now. Eventually, she will puff up as a red giant star and swallow many (or all) of her inner planets before her death as a nova billions of years from now. Earth may only be habitable for another billion years maximum — the sun's heat increases with its age, and Earth's core will one day no longer produce the magnetic field that protects Earth's surface from the impact of the solar wind. Any day now for the next 100,000 years, the star Betelgeuse in Orion's Belt could go supernova, and the explosion could be as bright as the half-moon, lasting for several months before fading.

Our incarnations a billion years from now will be on strange planets orbiting suns just blossoming into the caretakers of living beings. The universe is teeming with life.

When I was in my early twenties, I prayed to Hermes in his role as the God who conveys souls to the afterlife to ease my maternal grandfather's suffering as he passed. He had fallen, the doctor botched the anesthesia, and he was aspirating food into his lungs. He couldn't speak and clearly did not want any of us to see him in the state he was in. It was decided by the doctors, my mother, and my uncle that according to their father's wishes, given his prognosis, it was time to start pallative care. They removed the feeding tube. It could have taken him weeks to die. I prayed for a swift death, and he was gone within two days.

At some point in our lives, we will all need pallative care. The sun will rise, for us and others, until it, too, dies.
