- The Mechanics of Devotional Activity
	- Connecting to the God(s)
	- Requesting things from the God(s)
	- Acknowledging cycles
	
	- Offerings to the Gods
		- Incense, first fruits, flowers, libations
		- Meat/BBQ
		- Disposing of offerings
	- Opening and closing prayers
	- Example daily prayer
	- Example new moon prayer
	- Exercise: Create your own outline for a 5-10 minute prayer and offer that prayer in ritual. Make any edits you need to make, and ensure that a copy of that ritual outline (with all components) is on your phone or eReader so you can access it on the go

This chapter is about the mechanics of devotional activity — or, building on the successes you have built in previous chapters through establishing and maintaining a core ritual practice to enliven the rhythm of your life. Human lives are not the same from season to season, year to year, and decade to decade. We have life stages. The stars and planets trace out their orbits. Our sun, now a main sequence star, continues to eat her fuel, leaving just a little bit less to use an instant from now. Eventually, she will puff up as a red giant star and swallow many (or all) of her inner planets before her death as a nova billions of years from now. Earth may only be habitable for another billion years maximum — the sun's heat increases with its age, and Earth's core will one day no longer produce the magnetic field that protects Earth's surface from the impact of the solar wind. Any day now for the next 100,000 years, the star Betelgeuse in Orion's Belt could go supernova, and the explosion could be as bright as the half-moon, lasting for several months before fading.

Within our human lifetimes, there are times when we all pray for things we need in our lives: success at work, a new job, the satisfactory resolution of difficult interpersonal interactions, 


>There is, of course, a parallel with the sacred tradition which worships the former invisible [numbers] that are the causes of these [visible ones] by naming Night and Day as gods, as well as by delivering those things that commend one to the month and the year, the invocations and self-manifestations. These things are considered not as things to be totted up on one's fingers, but rather as among the things that have divine subsistence — things which the sacred laws of those who serve as priests command us to worship and honour by means of statues and sacrifices. The oracles of Apollo also confirm this, as the stories say, and when these things were honoured, the benefits that result from the periods belonged to human beings, both the benefits of the seasons and those of other [periods] similarly. However, when these things were neglected a condition contrary to nature was the result for everything around the Earth. Not only that, but Plato himself in the <em>Laws</em> (X 899b2) positively shouts out that all these things are gods: seasons, months and years — just like the stars and the Sun. We are introducing no sort of innovation when we say that it is worthwhile to conceive of the invisible powers that are prior to these visible things [as gods]. So much for these matters.  /
