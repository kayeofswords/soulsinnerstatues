This chapter is about the mechanics of devotional activity — or, building on the successes you have built in previous chapters through establishing and maintaining a core ritual practice to enliven the rhythm of your life. Human lives are not the same from season to season, year to year, and decade to decade. We have life stages. The stars and planets trace out their orbits.

Within our human lifetimes, there are times when we all pray for things we need in our lives: success at work, a new job, the satisfactory resolution of difficult interpersonal interactions, a better apartment, the ability to get to a flight on time.

We also pray according to seasons: when new herbs we are growing from seed first send up their shoots, when the ice and snow come and recede, for a gentle landfall of the hurricanes pummelling our shores during hurricane season. We pray for good harvests, happy new years, and abundant gift-giving seasons.

This chapter discusses how to incorporate these occasions into your practice. We will begin discussing the lunar and solar cycles.

## Following the Sun and Moon

>There is, of course, a parallel with the sacred tradition which worships the former invisible [numbers] that are the causes of these [visible ones] by naming Night and Day as gods, as well as by delivering those things that commend one to the month and the year, the invocations and self-manifestations. These things are considered not as things to be totted up on one's fingers, but rather as among the things that have divine subsistence — things which the sacred laws of those who serve as priests command us to worship and honour by means of statues and sacrifices. The oracles of Apollo also confirm this, as the stories say, and when these things were honoured, the benefits that result from the periods belonged to human beings, both the benefits of the seasons and those of other [periods] similarly. However, when these things were neglected a condition contrary to nature was the result for everything around the Earth. Not only that, but Plato himself in the <em>Laws</em> (X 899b2) positively shouts out that all these things are gods: seasons, months and years — just like the stars and the Sun. We are introducing no sort of innovation when we say that it is worthwhile to conceive of the invisible powers that are prior to these visible things [as gods]. So much for these matters.  /

## Praying for What Is Possible

The best time to start praying for something is at the beginning — weeks before you have that exam or performance evaluation when you start to feel the pressure. There is a fable from Aesop called "The Shipwrecked Man and Athene" in which a shipwrecked sailor prays to Athene (his city's patron Goddess) to be saved from the ocean. Another man, swimming by, says, "Pray to the Goddess for success, but move your arms!" — the Gods can open up pathways for us, but we need to commit effort.

Prayers at the last moment may sometimes be answered, but there is nothing strange about this — as souls who inhabit material bodies, and who are under the care of the Gods, it is in our nature to be able to *act in the material world* with these bodies. That is why we descend into generation (CITE the article + passages from others). 

One way to make this part of your life is to say a short prayer to major Gods you already pray to whenever you're about to start planning a project or writing a complex, multi-part to-do list. It doesn't need to be fancy, just a few words — and at the end of the project's completion, thank the Gods you prayed to with an offering that is slightly fancier than usual. It's up to you how to interpret *fancy*.

## Praying for What Is Inevitable

Our sun, now a main sequence star, continues to eat her fuel, leaving just a little bit less to use an instant from now. Eventually, she will puff up as a red giant star and swallow many (or all) of her inner planets before her death as a nova billions of years from now. Earth may only be habitable for another billion years maximum — the sun's heat increases with its age, and Earth's core will one day no longer produce the magnetic field that protects Earth's surface from the impact of the solar wind. Any day now for the next 100,000 years, the star Betelgeuse in Orion's Belt could go supernova, and the explosion could be as bright as the half-moon, lasting for several months before fading.

Our incarnations a billion years from now will be on strange planets orbiting suns just blossoming into the caretakers of living beings. The universe is teeming with life.

When I was in my early twenties, I prayed to Hermes in his role as the God who conveys souls to the afterlife to ease my maternal grandfather's suffering as he passed. He had fallen, the doctor botched the anesthesia, and he was aspirating food into his lungs. He couldn't speak and clearly did not want any of us to see him in the state he was in. It was decided by the doctors, my mother, and my uncle that according to their father's wishes, given his prognosis, it was time to start pallative care. They removed the feeding tube. It could have taken him weeks to die. I prayed for a swift death, and he was gone within two days.

At some point in our lives, we will all need pallative care. The sun will rise, for us and others, until it, too, dies.
